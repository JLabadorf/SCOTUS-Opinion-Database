A distinct purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to subject the administration of the estates of bankrupts to the control of tribunals clothed with authority and charged with the duty of proceeding to final settlement and distribution in a summary way as are the courts of bankruptcy.\"</p>\n<p><i>William Filene's Sons Co.</i> v. <i>Weed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99085\"><a href=\"/opinion/99085/william-filenes-sons-co-v-weed/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span>, 601, 602,  receivership in a court of equity which had possession of the corporate assets </p>\n<p>\"When a statutory system is administered the only question for the courts is what the statutes prescribe. But when the courts without statute take possession of all the assets of a corporation under a bill like the present and so make it impossible to collect debts except from the court's hands, . . . [then] In order to make a distribution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*333</span> possible, they must of necessity limit the time for the proof of claims.\"</p>\n<p><i>Van Huffel</i> v. <i>Harkelrode,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101814\"><a href=\"/opinion/101814/van-huffel-v-harkelrode/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 228 </p>\n<p>\"No good reason is suggested why liens for state taxes should be deemed to have been excluded from the scope of this general power to sell free from encumbrances. Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act grants to the court express authority to determine `the amount or legality' of any tax. . . . Realization upon the lien created by the state law must yield to the requirements of bankruptcy administration.\"</p>\n<p>The federal government possesses supreme power in respect of bankruptcies. <i>International Shoe Co.</i> v. <i>Pinkus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101360\"><a href=\"/opinion/101360/international-shoe-co-v-pinkus/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 265. If a state desires to participate in the assets of a bankrupt, she must submit to appropriate requirements by the controlling power; otherwise, orderly and expeditious proceedings would be impossible and a fundamental purpose of the Bankruptcy Act would be frustrated.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
