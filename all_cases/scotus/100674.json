The Missouri Pacific, relying upon Oregon-Washington Railroad &amp; Navigation Co. v. McGinn, 258 U. S. 409, 42 S. Ct. 332, 66 L. Ed. 689, requested the trial court to rule that, as the bill of lading provided that no connecting carrier should be liable for any damage which did not occur on its own lines, and delivery at the consignee's warehouse was part of an interstate shipment, the defendant was not liable, because it was neither the initial nor the delivering carrier. The court refused to rule as requested; the jury found for the plaintiff; and the judgment entered on the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 161 Ark. 579, 257 S. W. 70.
