The Company contended that the Commission's order was confiscatory, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. amend. 14. The Supreme Court reviewed at length the findings of the Commission and concluded that there should be a re-examination by the Commission of certain questions of fact as to elements of value. After stating these questions, the opinion of the Supreme Court concluded as follows: 'Subject to the foregoing, the judgment is affirmed and the cause remanded, with directions to the circuit court to remand to the commission that it may rehear and determine the facts on the four points above mentioned in accordance with the views in this opinion.'
