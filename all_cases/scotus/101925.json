The situation in which the railroads of the country were as a result of war-time government operation is well described in United Stated v. Guaranty Trust Co., 280 U. S. 478, 484, 50 S. Ct. 212, 74 L. Ed. 556. During that period their expenses had risen and there had been no commensurate increase in rates. While the government had either paid, or was obligated to pay, just compensation for their requisition, the amount of it was known to be insufficient for rehabilitation of the roads as privately owned and operated organizations. Until rates could be adjusted to meet increased expenses, loans be negotiated, and operating forces realigned and reintegrated, the credit of the carriers must by some means be re-established. Thus the government had a real obligation, not readily susceptible of accurate measurement, to assist in the restoration of normal conditions. The purpose of the guaranty provision was to stabilize the credit position of the roads by assuring them a minimum operating income. They were bound to operate their properties in order to avail themselves of the government's profer. Under the terms of the statute, no sum could be received save as a result of operation. If the fruits of the employment of a road's capital and labor should fall below a fixed minimum, then the government agreed to make up the deficiency, and, if the income were to exceed that minimum, the carrier bound itself to pay the dxcess into the federal treasury. In the latter event, the carrier unquestionably would have been obligated to pay income tax measured by actual earnings; in the former, it ought not to be in a better position than if it has earned the specified minimum. Clearly, then, the amount paid to bring the yield from operation up to the required minimum was as much income from operation as were the railroad's receipts from fares and charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sums received under the act were not subsidies or gifts-that is, contributions to the capital of the railroads-and this fact distinguishes cases such as Edwards v.
