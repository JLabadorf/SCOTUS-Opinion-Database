Before trial the relators obtained writs of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court of the State, at Special Term, which, being heard together, resulted in an order sustaining the writs and discharging the relators. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (197 App. Div. 225, 188 N. Y. Supp. 803), on appeal reversed this order and dismissed the writs; and the Court of Appeals of the State, on a further appeal, affirmed the order of the Appellate Division (232 N. Y. 96, 133 N. E. 364) and remitted the record and proceedings to the Supreme Court to be proceeded upon according to law.

In the opinion of that court, after passing upon the constitutional question, it was said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'A writ of habeas corpus cannot take the place of [of]      perform the functions of an appeal from a judgment of      conviction.
