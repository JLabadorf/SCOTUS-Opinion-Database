The respondent is the receiver of the La Salle Street Trust &amp; Savings Bank. When the Coal Company became bankrupt in 1913, the Bank held its note for $15,000, with security. Between November 11, 1913, and June 11, 1914, the trustees of the Coal Company in bankruptcy deposited in the Bank, an authorized depositary, and were credited as such trustees with funds of their estate, which amounted to nearly $20,000 on June 12, 1914, when the Bank suspended business, insolvent. A receiver was appointed by a State Court a few days later. The trustees of the Coal Company filed a claim for the amount of their deposit in 1916, and in 1916 and again in 1918 received dividends upon it. On the other side the receiver of the bank filed a proof of the bank's claim as unsecured in 1914 but amended it to proof of a secured claim in 1917. The petition before us seeks to set off the claim of the petitioner for the deposit in the Bank, less the dividends received, against the claim of the Bank upon the note. The Circuit Court of Appeals denied the set-off and ordered the petition to be dismissed. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. v.
