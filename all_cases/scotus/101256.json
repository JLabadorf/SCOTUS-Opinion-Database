D. Mitchell, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aniello Manzi filed his declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States October 15, 1913. He did December 19, 1914. On October 4, 1924, his widow Amalia, respondent herein, relying upon her husband's declaration, asked for citizenship. This was granted February 3, 1925, and certificate issued over the objection that her request came too late, more than seven years having passed since the husband made his declaration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">January 9, 1926, the United States began this proceeding by a petition in the District Court for Rhode Island to cancel her certificate upon the ground that it had been illegally procured. That court dismissed the petition and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. (16 F.(2d) 884.) The single question for our consideration is one of law: Whether it was unnecessary for respondent to declare her intention because her husband had declared his in 1913.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Solicitor General maintains, and we think rightly, that while a widow may have the benefit of her husband's declaration, she must perfect her citizenship under the restrictions specified for him, including the requirement that request for naturalization must come not more than seven years after such declaration. The intention of Congress was to treat the action of the husband as though taken by the widow herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act of June 29, 1906, 'to establish a Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and to provide for a uniform rule for the naturalization of aliens throughout the United States' (34 Stat. 596), definitely prescribes the circumstances under which aliens may be naturalized.

Not less than two years nor more than seven years      after he has made such declaration of intention he shall make      and file, in duplicate, a petition in writing, signed by the      applicant in his own handwriting and duly verified, in which      petition such applicant shall state his full name, his place      of residence (by street and number, if possible), his      occupation, and, if possible, the date and place of his      birth; the place from which he emigrated, and the date and      place of his arrival in the United States, and, if he entered      through a port, the name of the vessel on which he arrived;      the time when and the place and name of the court where he      declared his intention to become a citizen of the United      States; if he is married he shall state the name of his wife      and, if possible, the country of her nativity and her place      of residence at the time of filing his petition; and if he      has children, the name, date, and place of birth and place of      residence of each child living at the time of the filing of      his petition: Provided, That if he has filed his declaration      before the passage of this Act he shall not be required to      sign the petition in his own handwriting.' 8 USCA &#167; 379.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sixth. When any alien who had declared his intention to      become a citizen of the United States dies before he is      actually naturalized the widow and minor children of such      alien may, by complying with the other provisions of this      Act, be naturalized without making any declaration of      intention.' 8 USCA &#167; 375.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 27.
