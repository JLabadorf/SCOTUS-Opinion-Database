Laws, c. 60) &#167; 350 et seq. The relator sought review by the Supreme Court of New York, invoking rights under the Constitution and laws of the state of New York and under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Department, annulled the determination of the state tax commission. Pierson v. Lynch, 237 App.Div. 763, 263 N.Y.S. 259. That court, while citing decisions of this Court under the Fourteenth Amendment, did not state that its decision rested upon the application of the Constitution of the United States. The Court of Appeals of the state affirmed the order of the Appellate Division, but without opinion (263 N.Y. 533, 189 N.E. 684), and the grounds of its decision are left to conjecture. It may be surmised, from the quotations in its opinion, that the Appellate Division intended to rest its decision upon a determination of the application of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the affirmance by the Court of Appeals went upon the same ground, and not upon the nonfederal ground of the application of the Constitution and laws of the state. But jurisdiction cannot be founded upon surmise.
