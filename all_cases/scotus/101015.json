The contract provided that upon written notice the government might make changes in the specifications, increased cost, if any, to be paid, and, for any delay in consequence thereof, a corresponding extension of time for the performance of the contract to be allowed. After the Armistice appellant was requested to suspend work, with a view to the negotiation of a supplemental contract providing for the cancellation, settlement, and adjustment of the existing contract. Subsequently appellant filed a claim; and a partial payment supplemental contract was executed, by which the government agreed to make appellant an advance payment and speedily determine and pay certain specified items. Appellant agreed that it would not perform further work or services, or incur further expense in connection with the performance of the uncompleted part of its original contract, and expressly waived 'all claim to the prospective profits which he (it) might have made from the performance of that portion of said original contract which under the terms of this supplemental agreement will not be performed.' The advance payment was made, and the court below found that, after its deduction and the allowance of another credit, there was due appellant a balance of $14,192.25; and it refused to allow appellant anything for profits which appellant would have realized if the contract had been performed.
