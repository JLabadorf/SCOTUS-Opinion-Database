Respondent is a common carrier by railroad wholly within that state engaged in intrastate and interstate commerce. And the Safety Appliance Acts make it unlawful for it to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In accordance with the Ohio Workmen's Compensation Act,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> petitioner and respondent had theretofore notified the Industrial Commission that they elected, in case of any injury sustained by petitioner while engaged in intrastate commerce, to have their respective rights and liabilities governed by the provisions of that act. The commission had approved the agreement, respondent paid the premiums necessary to keep it in force, and in all respects complied with the law.

In addition to a denial of the violation of the statutes, respondent's answer sets up the election to be bound by the state Compensation Act. The court held that the agreement was not sufficient to constitute a defense, and struck out that part of the answer. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for petitioner. The court of appeals reversed and gave final judgment in favor of the respondont, 'for the reason that the acceptance and notice of election by the employee contract approved by the Industrial Commission of Ohio is a complete bar to a right of recovery in this action.'

The power conferred upon the Congress is such that when exerted it excludes and supersedes state legislation in respect of the same matter. But Congress may so circumscribe its regulation as to leave a part of the subject open to state action. Atlantic Coast Line v. Georgia, 234 U.S. 280, 290, 34 S.Ct. 829, 58 L.Ed. 1312. Cf. Napier v.

There we were called upon to decide whether a railroad employee engaged in intrastate commerce upon the line of an interstate carrier was within the protection of the Safety Appliance Acts. We held that he was. The opinion supports our recent construction of these acts that, while they prescribe the duty, the right to recover damages sustained by the injured employee through the breach 'sprang from the principle of the common law' and was left to be enforced accordingly, or in case of death 'according to the applicable statute.'

But the absence of a declaration similar to that in the Federal Employers Liability Act. which denounces contracts and other arrangements made for the purpose of exempting carriers from liability created by that Act (45 U.S.C., § 55), strongly suggests a lack of legislative purpose to create any cause of action therefor. Moreover, if there had been such purpose, Congress probably would have included provisions in respect of venue, jurisdiction of courts, limitations, measure of damages, and beneficiaries in case of death.</p>\n<p>Petitioner cites language in <i>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co.</i> v. <i>Rigsby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98712\"><a href=\"/opinion/98712/texas-pacific-r-co-v-rigsby/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 41. But that case is not in point on the question under consideration in this case. There we were called upon to decide whether a railroad employee engaged in intrastate commerce upon the line of an interstate carrier was within the protection of the Safety Appliance Acts. We held that he was. The opinion supports our recent construction of these Acts that, while they prescribe the duty, the right to recover damages sustained by the injured employee through the breach \"sprang from the principle of the common law\" and was left to be enforced accordingly, or in case of death \"according to the applicable statute.\" <i>Moore</i> v. <i>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 215. <i>Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S.S.M. Ry. Co.</i> v. <i>Popplar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98444\"><a href=\"/opinion/98444/minneapolis-st-p-s-ste-mr-co-v-popplar/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, 372. These Acts do not create, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> prescribe the measure or govern the enforcement of, the liability arising from the breach. They do not extend to the field occupied by the state compensation Act. There is nothing in the agreement repugnant to them.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STONE and MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO concur in the result.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   § 2, Act of March 2, 1893, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C., § 2. § 1, Act of March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 943, 45 U.S.C., § 8.</p>\n<p>[2]   \"The provisions of this act shall apply to employers and their employee engaged in intrastate and also in interstate and foreign commerce, for whom a rule of liability or method of compensation has been or may be established by the congress of the United States, only to the extent that their mutual connection with intrastate work may and shall be clearly separable and distinguishable from interstate or foreign commerce, and then only when such employer and any of his workmen working only in this state, with the approval of the state liability board of awards, and so far as not forbidden by any act of congress, voluntarily accept the provisions of this act by filing written acceptances, which, when filed with and approved by the board, shall subject the acceptors irrevocably to the provisions of this act to all intents and purposes as if they had been originally included in its terms, during the period or periods for which the premiums herein provided have been paid.
