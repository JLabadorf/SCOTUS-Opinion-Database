The Supreme Court granted a writ of error, reversed the Court of Civil Appeals and affirmed the original judgment. It concluded that, viewing all the evidence, there was enough to show negligence and causal connection between this and the death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter is here by certiorari. The railway sets up a claim under the federal statute which it has not heretofore had opportunity to submit for adjudication to any federal tribunal.

We can find no evidence from which it may be properly concluded that Moore's tragic death was the result of negligence by the railway company. As often pointed out, one who claims under the Federal Act must in some adequate way establish negligence and causal connection between this and the injury. New York Central Railroad Co. v.

When last seen, the deceased was running westwardly by the side of the train then moving in that direction. Across the pathway commonly used by trainmen, there was a slight depression-estimated to be four or five, or possibly six or eight, feet long and three feet wide-filed with small rock screenings. It was softer than other portions of the way-yielded to the foot.

He said it 'was deeper then the footprint that I made, it looked as though somebody that was heavy or running had stepped in it. The front part of the foot was deepest.' There is no evidence-nothing but conjecture-to show that the deceased made this impression; and, even if he did, we cannot assume that by stepping there he was made to stumble and fall under the moving train.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What occasioned this distressing accident can only be surmised.
