Davis, Agent, etc, has been substituted&#8212;and another, wherein he asked to recover for damage sustained by his vessel when in collision with the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company's car float No. 46. He alleged that the collision resulted solely from negligence of the float and those in charge of her; that the President took possession of all systems of transportation December 28, 1917, through the Director General; and 'that at all the times herein mentioned the car float No. 46 was managed, operated, and owned by the said New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company under the control or operation of the said Director General of Railroads.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 'Director General of Railroads of the United States (New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad)' answered and denied liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appeared from the evidence that while moored at Pier 2, Erie Basin, March 28, 1919, the Mary Ethel suffered damage by contact with car float No. 46 of the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, negligently cast loose by a New York Central Railroad tug.

The effect of section 10 and General Order 50a were discussed in Missouri Pacific R. R. v. Ault, 256 U. S. 554, 560, 41 Sup. Ct. 593, 65 L. Ed. 1087, and it was there pointed out that while the transportation systems were controlled and administered by the United States they were treated as separate entities, 'regarded much as ships are regarded in admiralty,' and 'dealt with as active responsible parties answerable for their own wrongs.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As well pointed out in Manbar Coal Co. v. Davis, Agent (Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, March 10, 1924) 297 Fed. 24, no one was given the right to sue the Director General as operator of all railroads, but his liability was carefully limited to such as would have been incurred by some particular carrier if there had been no federal control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the Director General came into court to defend only against a liability asserted because of the negligence of agents operating the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford system, and not because of anything which might have been done or omitted by those of another system. In such circumstances, under the statute and orders, we think the court could adjudge no liability against him, except such as might have been enforced against the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Company before federal control. Under those conditions the United States consented to be proceeded against. One reason therefor, if any is necessary, seems plain enough. Every system was operated as an entity; its agents and employes knew and carried on its ordinary affairs, but not those of other carriers. The Director General necessarily relied upon the organization of each system, and could demand notice sufficient to set the proper one in motion; otherwise, proper defenses might not be presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
