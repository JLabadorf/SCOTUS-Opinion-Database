E. 419. The appellant was incorporated in Delaware, in December, 1928, and was given by its charter not only power to engage in international, interstate and intrastate express business, but other most extensive ones to own personal and real property and to engage in other collateral undertakings. Its stock was to be owned by railroad corporations. It has bought the business and assumed the liabilities of the American Railway Express Company, and is an agency of railroads throughout the United States. The appellant's right to do interstate business is not questioned, but it was held by the Supreme Court of Appeals that being a foreign corporation created since the Constitution of the State went into effect in 1902, it was prohibited by that instrument from doing intrastate express business by the plain words of section 163.

It simply is refusing to grant a foreign corporation a permit to transact local business without taking out a charter from the jurisdiction within which that business must be done. There is no substantial evidence that the refusal would impose a burden on interstate commerce and it is presumed to be constitutional. O'Gorman &amp; Young, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co.
