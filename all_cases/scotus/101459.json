This release was made in consideration of a perpetual grant by the state, made after the passage of the Act of March 23, 1840 (38 Ohio Laws, p. 87), discussed at length in our opinion in No. 674, Kirk v. Maumee Valley Electric Co., supra. By the grant the state sold and conveyed a specified quantity of water 'except when otherwise necessary for the navigation of the canal' and the contract as readjusted was similarly restricted. The grant was subject to the limitations of the statute of 1840, and the rights conferred under it did not, for present purposes, differ from those considered in No. 674. They were likewise subject to the reserved power of the state to abandon the canal and devote it to other purposes, which was exercised by the Act of the Ohio Legislature of May 11, 1927 (112 Ohio Laws, p. 360).
