Demurrers were interposed to the indictment upon the ground that the facts set forth were not sufficient in law to charge any crime against the defendants, because the information so published was open to public inspection, constituted a public record available to the general public, and, consequently, was proper matter for news publication; and that, if any statute attempted to forbid or penalize such publication, it contravened the First Amendment to the federal Constitution, which prohibits Congress from making any law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. The court below sustained the demurrers and dismissed the indictment. 3 F.

S. &#167; 3167, copied in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Section 257(b) of the same act, 43 Stat. 293, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The Commissioner shall as soon as practicable in each year      cause to be prepared and made available to public inspection      in such manner as he may determine, in the office of the      collector in each internal revenue district and in such other      places as he may determine, lists containing the name and the      post office address of each person making an income tax      return in such district, together with the amount of the      income tax paid by such person.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prohibition against publication contained in section 3167, it will be seen, is not absolute, but subject to possible qualification by other provisions of law. The language is that it shall be unlawful to print or publish in any manner 'not provided by law' any income return or any part thereof, etc. On behalf of defendants in error, it is contended that section 257(b) effects such a qualification. To this the government replies that the extent to which that provision goes is to authorize the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to make available for public inspection lists showing names of taxpayers and amounts of taxes paid by them; and that this falls short of authorizing the printing and publishing of the information contained in the lists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Something is said in the briefs, and was said at the bar, as to the wisdom, on the one hand, of secrecy, and, on the other hand, of publicity, in respect of tax returns. But that is a matter addressed to the discretion of the lawmaking department, with which the courts are not concerned, so long as no constitutional right or privilege of the taxpayer is invaded; and there is no contention that there is any such invasion here, whichever view may be adopted. The problem, therefore, is, primarily, one of statutory construction, the disposition of which will determine whether the constitutional question as to the freedom of the press needs to be considered. For the purposes of the inquiry, we assume the power of Congress to forbid or to allow such publication, as in the judgment of that body the public interest may require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner is directed to make the lists of taxpayers and amounts paid available for public inspection in the office of the collector and elsewhere as he may determine. His discretion in that respect is limited only by his own sense of what is wise and expedient. And the inquiry at once suggests itself: To what end is this discretion, so vested in him, to be exercised? The obvious answer is: To the end that the names and addresses of the taxpayers and the amounts paid by them may be generally known. To the extent of the information authorized to be put into the lists, this is the manifest policy of the statute, with which the application of section 3167 to the present case, it fairly may be argued, will be out of harmony. Whatever one's opinion may be in respect of its wisdom, the policy having been adopted as an aid to the enforcement of the revenue laws or to the accomplishment of some other object deemed important, it is not easy to conclude that Congress nevertheless intended to exclude and severely to penalize the effective form of secondary publicity now under consideration. Information, which everybody is at liberty to acquire and the acquisition of which Congress seemed especially desirous of facilitating, in the absence of some clear and positive provision to the contrary, cannot be regarded otherwise than as public property, to be passed on to others as freely as the possessors of it may choose.

That act further provided (page 1087) that the Commissioner should cause to be prepared and made available to public inspection, etc., 'lists containing the names and the post office addresses of all individuals making income tax returns in such district'; and this was expanded by the present law, section 257(b), Act of 1924, to include the amount of the income tax paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is significant that, while these progressively liberal publicity amendments were being made, section 3167&#8212;to the general rule of which they were in terms opposed&#8212;was carried along by re-enactment without change, plainly indicating that, in the opinion of Congress, by the application of the qualifying clause 'not provided by law,' the scope of the general rule against publication would become automatically narrowed to the extent of the liberalizing exceptions.
