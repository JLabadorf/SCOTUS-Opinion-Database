The suit was brought for the infringement of the common-law right of property in a song, and the bill sought an accounting of profits made by the defendant. The District Court sustained the plaintiff's right as author and found infringement. Decree was entered granting an injunction and appointing a special master to take and state an account of profits and to report to the court, with the usual provisions for exceptions to the report. The decree was interlocutory. The Palmyra, 10 Wheat. 502, 6 L.Ed. 376; Perkins v. Fourniquet, 6 How. 206, 208, 209, 12 L.Ed. 406; Craighead v.

Grier Brothers Co., 258 U.S. 82, 89, 42 S.Ct. 196, 66 L.Ed. 475. The decree was entered on March 31, 1933, and the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals was not taken until May 18, 1933. The Circuit Court of Appeals entertained the appeal and reversed the decree of the District Court.
