St. &#167; 991), to recover $7,581.95, alleged to be due upon a contract between plaintiff and defendant. The court gave judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals on writ of error, but it should have been brought to this court. J. Homer Fritch, Inc., v. United States, 248 U. S. 458, 39 S. Ct. 158, 63 L. Ed. 359; Campbell v. United States, 266 U. S. 368, 45 S. Ct. 115. The case was transferred to this court under section 238a, Judicial Code (Act Sept. 14, 1922, c. 305, 42 Stat. 837 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, &#167; 1215a]) (C. C. A.

By it, plaintiff agreed to furnish two flywheels according to certain drawings, each to be cast in halves 'in the rough.' Delivery was to be made by September 28, 1918, at Reading, Pa., for shipment to the De La Vergne Machine Company, New York City. The contract contained a provision that upon delivery, and as a condition precedent to their acceptance, the castings should be inspected and approved by defendant, and that any article not so approved would be rejected, and should be removed by plaintiff immediately after receipt of notification of such rejection. The court found facts as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The plaintiff failed to perform its contract in that the      castings were defective because of the presence of checks.      These defects could have been remedied by welding, and the      castings thus made to conform to contract. The extent of the      cracks and the consequent required welding could not be      determined until after the castings had been machined.      Plaintiff sent the castings to the company which was to do      the machining, and plaintiff was given the privilege of      welding the cracks when disclosed by the machining. This      welding was, however, not done, nor the castings made as      required by the contract. The smaller casting which was the      first casting supplied was inspected and rejected within a reasonable time. After partial welding      it was again inspected and rejected within a reasonable time.      The large casting was not inspected until after a reasonable      time. This wheel was shipped December 27, 1918, and reached      its destination before February 7, 1919. It had not been      inspected on December 6, 1919, and notice of inspection and      rejection was not given until October 26, 1920, after suit      brought.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, defendant contends that the plaintiff was bound by the contract to weld checks disclosed by machining, and the plaintiff so construes the contract. The facts admitted and the concessions made by the parties may be considered with the findings of fact made by the district court. This is not inconsistent with the rule stated in Crocker v. United States, 240 U. S. 74, 78, 36 S. Ct. 245, 60 L. Ed. 533, restricting our inquiry to a consideration of the case on the findings. See Ackerlind v. United States, 240 U. S. 531, 535, 36 S. Ct. 438, 60 L. Ed. 783. The contract is to be construed and the rights of the parties are to be determined by the application of the same principles as if the contract were between individuals.
