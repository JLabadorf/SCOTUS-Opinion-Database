Recognizing the high consideration always due diplomatic representatives of friendly nations, we entertained the petition and directed a rule to show cause why relief should not be granted.

He protested against exercise of jurisdiction by the court, and asked that the proceedings be dismissed. The Secretary of State gave no sanction or approval to this course, but certified the diplomatic position of the Minister. Upon motion the suggestion was stricken from the files. Final judgment for the libelant followed and, upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this, with interest and damages, October 1, 1923. (No opinion).
