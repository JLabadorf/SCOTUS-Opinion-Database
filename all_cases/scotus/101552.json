Thereafter the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, purporting to proceed under authority of the Revenue Act of 1918, tit. 4, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096, 1097, demanded that her executors pay additional taxes reckoned upon the value of the property held under the above-described trust instrument. Having paid the required sum, the executors-petitioners here-asked that it be refunded. By order of February 20, 1924, the Commissioner denied their request. In support of this action he said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This trust was included in decedent's gross estate on final      audit and review on the ground that it was intended to take      effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. In this      case the principal of the trust fund could not take effect in      possession until the death of the decedent. According to the      provisions of the trust agreement, if the decedent's husband      died before her, the income was to be paid to her until her      death. The gift of the principal, therefore, could not take      effect during the decedent's lifetime. This case comes      literally within the terms of the statute, and it has been      held by a number of courts in different States that such a      transfer as this is taxable, these cases being decided under      statutes using the same language as is contained in the      Federal Estate Tax Law.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to enforce their claim the executors sued the collector in the District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania; judgment in his favor was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.

It was not testamentary in character and was beyond recall by the decedent.
