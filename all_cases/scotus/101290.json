St. &#167; 3115 1/2 aa, property of domestic corporations, seized during war with Germany cannot be treated as owned by enemy, so as to preclude recovery of compensation from United States for use thereof, because their entire capital stock belonged to German corporation.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, having power to direct forfeiture of all property beneficially owned by enemy subjects during war, could provide for seizure thereof, followed by such compensation as President might determine, as was done by Trading with the Enemy Act (50 USCA Appendix; Comp.

Cl. 461. For the views of that court, see Deutsch-Australische Dampfschiffs-Gesellschaft, Appellant v. United States, 59 Ct. Cl. 450. Appellants are incorporated under the laws of New Jersey and their entire capital stock has long been owned by the Hamburg-American Line, a German corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cause No. 3, the appellant seeks to recover (1) compensation for the use of certain docks and piers, New York harbor, seized by the United States April 6, 1917, and used by them until June 28, 1918; and (2) interest on the sum awarded by the President (December 3, 1918) as compensation for the same property, from June 28, 1918, when title was taken thereto until January 5, 1919, the date of actual payment. In cause No. 4 the claim is for the value of two tugboats, launch, barge, and coal hoister requisitioned and taken by the United States April 6, 1917, at the port of New York; and in No. 5 judgment is asked because of three barges, likewise taken on the same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below evidently proceeded upon the view that the property of appellant corporations should be treated as owned by an enemy because their entire capital stock belonged to a German corporation. And as the property was seized during the war with Germany it held there could be no recovery. Without doubt Congress might have accepted and acted upon that theory. It was adopted in the St. Tudno, Lloyd's Reports of Prize Cases, vol. V, p. 198, and the Michigan, Lloyd's Reports of Prize Cases, vol. V, p. 421. But Congress did not do so; it definitely adopted the policy of disregarding stock ownership as a test of enemy character and permitted property of domestic corporations to be dealt with as nonenemy. The prescribed plan was to seize the shares of stock when enemy owned rather than to take over the corporate property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trading with the Enemy Act, approved October 6, 1917 (chapter 106, 40 Stat. 411 (50 USCA Appendix, &#167; 2(a), Comp.

As Congress might have directed forfeiture of all property beneficially owned by enemy subjects, it had power to provide for seizure followed by such compensation as the President might determine.

If title to the vessels described in cause No. 5 was actually taken, the United States became liable for their value.
