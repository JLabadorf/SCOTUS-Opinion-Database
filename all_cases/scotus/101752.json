Following a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals which upheld respondent's determination of tax deficiencies against petitioner for both years, 14 B. T.

This Court granted certiorari, 282 U. S. 835, 51 S. Ct. 179, 75 L. Ed. &#8212;, January 5, 1931, the government acquiescing because of the importance of the question and the conflict of the decision below with one of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit where, however, the point was neither discussed, Simmons Co. v.

See Kansas City Ry. Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 760, 51 S. Ct. 304, 75 L. Ed. 684, decided February 25, 1931.
