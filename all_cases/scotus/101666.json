He paid out $78,153.84 for interest on money borrowed by himself in due course for the purpose of purchasing and carrying exempt securities. In his return showing income received during that year, he excluded the interest so collected, and he claimed deduction for the interest paid out on the borrowed money. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction, and made a corresponding additional assessment.

Also that the act is discriminatory and unconstitutional, in that necessary expenses incident to all other kinds of business, including interest paid for purchasing and carrying merchandise and inventories, are allowed as part of the operating cost, whereas deduction of interest paid by plaintiff upon funds borrowed to carry nontaxable securities (an ordinary operating expense) is prohibited.

It was proper to make provision to prevent such a possibility. The classification complained of is not arbitrary, makes no improper discrimination, does not result in defeating any guaranteed exemption, and was within the power of Congress. The fact that respondent engaged in the business of buying and selling is not important. See Willcuts, etc., v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 51 S. Ct. 125, 75 L.
