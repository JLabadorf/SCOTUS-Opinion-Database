St. &#167; 1227), from a writ of mandamus compelling the Secretary of the Interior to consider and allow a claim of the Chestatee Pyrites &amp; Chemical Corporation, under section 5 of the Dent Act (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. &#167; 3115 14/15 e). It presents questions very similar to those heard in Work v. United States ex rel. Rives, 267 U. S. 175, 45 S. Ct. 252, 69 L.

In compliance with the request of the government to enlarge its plant to meet the war necessities, it borrowed the sum of $695,000, on which it obligated itself to pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. After three hearings before the Secretary of the Interior, it was awarded $693,313.79. In making the award the item of interest claimed of more than $40,000 on the amount borrowed was disallowed.

That was an appeal from a decision of the Court of Claims in a case brought by the state of New York against the United States under a statute of the United States, by which the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to pay out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to the governor of any state, the costs, charges and expenses properly incurred by such state for enrolling, subsisting, clothing, supplying, arming, equipping, paying and transporting its troops employed in aiding to suppress the insurrection against the United States.
