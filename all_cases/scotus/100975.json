Banco Mexicano v. Deutsche Bank, 263 U. S. 591, 44 S. Ct. 209, 68 L. Ed. 465. Considering the facts disclosed and the definite terms of the statute, this action was clearly right. Subsection (e) of section 9 provides: 'No money or other property shall be returned nor any debt      allowed under this section to any person who is a citizen or      subject of any nation which was associated with the United      States in the prosecution of the war, unless such nation in      like case extends reciprocal rights to citizens of the United      States; nor in any event shall a debt be allowed under this      section unless it was owing to and owned by the claimant      prior to October 6, 1917, and as to claimants other than      citizens of the United States unless it arose with reference      to the money or other property held by the Alien Property      Custodian or Treasurer of the United States hereunder.'</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">No. 55 is a separate appeal by a receiver.

Thereafter he asked to be made party to cause No. 54, claiming that by reason of such appointment he had an interest in the fund held by the Custodian. The trial court denied this application and upon appeal the court below affirmed that action. The claim is without merit.
