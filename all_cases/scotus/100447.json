The plaintiffs in error were indicted and convicted of having whisky in their possession in the Indian country, in Osage county, Okl., on July 24, 1920, in violation of the acts above mentioned. The case was taken on writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, and that court, under section 239 of the Judicial Code (Comp.
