Section 48 gives jurisdiction of suits for patent infringement to the United States district courts in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or in any district in which the defendant shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business.

That section applied to suits for patent infringement. Chaffee v. Hayward, 20 How. 208, 216, 15 L.Ed. 804, 851; Allen v. Blunt, Fed.Cas.No.215, 1 Blatchf. 480. The Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, retained the provision allowing suit wherever the defendant could be found. The abuses engendered by this extensive venue prompted the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552, which as amended by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, permitted civil suits to be instituted only in the district of which the defendant was an inhabitant, except that in diversity jurisdiction cases suit could be started in the district of the plaintiff's or the defendant's residence. The substance of those provisions was reenacted as Section 51 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. &#167; 112, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 112).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the holding of In re Hohorst, 150 U.S. 653, 14 S.Ct. 221, 225, 37 L.Ed. 1211, that the Act of 1887 as amended did not apply to a suit against an alien or a foreign corporation 'especially in a suit for the infringement of a patent right', the lower federal courts became uncertain as to the applicability of the Act of 1887 to patent infringement proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In explanation of Hohorst's case it was said Re Keasbey &amp; Mattison Co., 160 U.S. 221, 230, 16 S.Ct. 273, 275, 40 L.Ed. 402, that 'It was a suit for infringement of a patent right, exclusive jurisdiction of which had been granted to the circuit courts of the United States * * *; and was therefore not affected by general provisions regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, concurrent with that of the several states'. Thereafter the lower federal courts for the most part took the position that the Act of 1887 as amended did not apply to suits for patent infringement, and that infringers could be sued wherever they could be found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act of 1897 was adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights and thus eliminate the uncertainty produced by the conflicting decisions on the applicability of the Act of 1887 as amended to such litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> That purpose indicates that Congress did not intend the Act of 1897 to dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil suits, but rather that it alone should control venue in patent infringement proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 52 is derived from R.S. &#167; 740, which in turn stems from the Act of May 4, 1858, c. 27, 11 Stat. 272, a general act intended to do away with the insertion of special provisions preserving state-wide venue in acts dividing a state into two or more judicial districts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and the Act of February 24, 1863, c. 54, &#167; 9, 12 Stat. 662. Respondents insist that Section 52 applies to patent infringement suits because it antedates Section 48, excludes from its purview only suits of a local nature, and is consistent with and complementary to Section 48 since it deals with the problem of venue in the geographical sense rather than in terms of specified classes of litigation.

Quite the contrary, for Section 52 appears in the Judicial Code as an exception to Section 51, the general venue provision derived from the Act of 1887, as amended. See Camp v. Gress, 250 U.S. 308, 315, 39 S.Ct. 478, 481, 63 L.Ed. 997. Section 51 is, of course, not applicable to patent infringement proceedings. General Elec. Co. v.

Conflicting decisions have been arisen in the different districts in the same States as to the construction of these acts of 1887 and 1888, and there is great uncertainty throughout the country as to whether or not the act of 1887 as amended by the act of 1888 applied to patent cases at all.</p>\n        <p>'The bill is intended to remove this uncertainty and to define the exact jurisdiction of the circuit courts in these matters.</p>\n        <p>'The committee have been extremely careful in the investigation of the matter before reporting the bill.</p>\n        <p>'As the bill was referred to me, I wrote to a great many patent lawyers in different parts of the country, in order to get their views and objections, if any, and I find that they are all unanimously in favor of the bill as it is now reported, and state that it would tend not only to define the jurisdiction of the circuit courts not now defined, but also limit that jurisdiction and so clearly define it that in the future there will be no question with regard to the application of the acts of 1887 and 1888.</p>\n        <p>'* * * The trouble has arisen in this matter that under the act of 1888 some of the courts were uncertain whether or not the law did or did not apply to patent cases, and therefore this special bill relating to patents solely has been brought up because of the indefiniteness and uncertainty arising from different constructions of the act of 1888 as applied to patent cases.'</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> See the remarks of Senator Pugh who reported the bill for the Senate Judiciary Committee. 36 Cong.

A.D. Caesar</i> and <i>Charles W. Rivise</i> for petitioner.</p>\n<p><i>Mr. Isaac J. Silin</i> for respondents.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The only question presented for our determination is whether § 48 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. § 109) is the sole provision governing the venue of patent infringement litigation, or whether that section is supplemented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> by § 52 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. § 113). Section 48 gives jurisdiction of suits for patent infringement to the United States district courts in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in any district in which the defendant shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business. Section 52 permits suits, not of a local nature, against two or more defendants, residing in different judicial districts within the same state, to be brought in either district.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Petitioner, Stonite Products Company, an inhabitant of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania without a regular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*563</span> and established place of business in the Western District of that State, was sued jointly with Lowe Supply Company, an inhabitant of the Western District, in the Western District for infringement of Patent No. 1,777,759 for a boiler stand. Petitioner was served with process in the Eastern District, entered a special appearance in the action in the Western District, and moved to dismiss or quash the return of service because venue was laid in the wrong district. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the cause as to petitioner.<sup>[2]</sup> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

That section applied to suits for patent infringement. <i>Chaffee</i> v. <i>Hayward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87146\"><a href=\"/opinion/87146/chaffee-v-hayward/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 216; <i>Allen</i> v. <i>Blunt,</i> 1 Blatchf. 408, Fed. Cas. No. 215. The Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470, retained the provision allowing suit wherever the defendant could be found. The abuses engendered by this extensive venue prompted the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 373, 24 Stat. 552, which, as amended by the Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433, permitted civil suits to be instituted only in the district of which the defendant was an inhabitant, except <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> that in diversity jurisdiction cases suit could be started in the district of the plaintiff's or the defendant's residence. The substance of those provisions was reenacted as § 51 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. § 112).</p>\n<p>After the holding of <i>In re Hohorst,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93739\"><a href=\"/opinion/93739/in-re-hohorst/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, that the Act of 1887 as amended did not apply to a suit against an alien or a foreign corporation, \"especially in a suit for the infringement of a patent right,\" the lower federal courts became uncertain as to the applicability of the Act of 1887 to patent infringement proceedings.<sup>[3]</sup> In explanation of <i>Hohorst's</i> case, it was said in <i>In re Keasbey &amp; Mattison Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94316\"><a href=\"/opinion/94316/in-re-keasbey-mattison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 230, that \"It was a suit for infringement of a patent right, exclusive jurisdiction of which had been granted to the Circuit Courts of the United States . . .; and was therefore not affected by general provisions regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, concurrent with that of the several States.\" Thereafter the lower federal courts, for the most part, took the position that the Act of 1887 as amended did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> not apply to suits for patent infringement, and that infringers could be sued wherever they could be found.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Act of 1897 was adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights, and thus eliminate the uncertainty produced by the conflicting decisions on the applicability of the Act of 1887, as amended, to such litigation.<sup>[5]</sup> That purpose indicates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> that Congress did not intend the Act of 1897 to dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil suits, but rather that it alone should control venue in patent infringement proceedings.</p>\n<p>Section 52 is derived from R.S. § 740, which in turn stems from the Act of May 4, 1858, c. 27, 11 Stat. 272, a general act intended to do away with the insertion of special provisions preserving statewide venue in acts dividing a state into two or more judicial districts,<sup>[6]</sup> and the Act of February 24, 1863, c. 54 § 9, 12 Stat. 662. Respondents insist that § 52 applies to patent infringement suits because it antedates § 48, excludes from its purview only suits of a local nature, and is consistent with and complementary to § 48, since it deals with the problem of venue in the geographical sense rather than in terms of specified classes of litigation. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p>Even assuming that R.S. § 740 covered patent litigation prior to the Act of 1897, we do not think that its application survived that act, which was intended to define the exact limits of venue in patent infringement suits.<sup>[7]</sup> Furthermore, the Act of 1897 was a restrictive measure, limiting a prior, broader venue. <i>General Electric Co.</i> v. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> <i>Marvel Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101996\"><a href=\"/opinion/101996/general-elec-co-v-marvel-rare-metals-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 434-435; <i>Bowers</i> v. <i>Atlantic, G. &amp; P.
