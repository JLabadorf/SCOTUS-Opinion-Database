The lands in dispute were allotted under that section, and the real controversy here is over its construction. It is part of a special law put in force with the solicited assent of the Choctaws and Chickasaws and applicable only to them. We think it would be understood by the Indians as meaning that lands allotted under it in the name of a deceased member should pass to those who would be his or her heirs according to chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest. With that chapter specially designated and chapter 20-the sole basis of the Arkansas law of curtesy-not mentioned the Indians certainly would not understand that curtesy was intended. It follows that section 22 must be construed as intended to pass the full title free from any claim to curtesy. Marlin v. Lewallen, 276 U. S. 58, 48 S. Ct. 248, 72 L.
