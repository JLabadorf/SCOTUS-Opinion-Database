Flagler died on May 20, 1913. Petitioners are legatees under a testamentary trust created under his will. The trust continued for a period of ten years from his death and terminated on May 20, 1923. As of that time the trustees delivered to petitioners<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> certain securities which were sold by them in 1934 and 1936.

For the reasons stated in Helvering v. Reynolds, supra, the proper basis was the value of the securities at the death of the decedent.
