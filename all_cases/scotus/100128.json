The by-laws provide that no person can secure membership until the board of directors has accepted his application at the home office and certificate has issued. Such certificates are mailed as directed by the applicants.</p>\n<p>Assessments and dues are payable at the Minneapolis office and notices in respect of them are mailed to members at their last known addresses.</p>\n<p>New members are procured by advertisement and through the solicitation of older ones. The latter are urged to furnish lists of prospects and to use their influence to increase the membership; but no member has authority to bind the Association. Although not essential, applications frequently bear a member's recommendation. Soliciting members receive no compensation except occasional premiums or prizes. No paid solicitors or agents are employed.</p>\n<p>Losses are settled by checks on Minneapolis banks mailed from the home office. Proofs of loss must be made on the forms provided. In case the attending physician's certificate is inadequate, the Association procures additional information through some local physician, but no resident physicians are employed outside of Minnesota. The right to make further investigation is reserved; but there is no evidence to show anything has been done under this reservation in the present case. Losses are adjusted by the directors in Minneapolis.</p>\n<p>The Association accepted Robert J. Benn's application for health insurance, solicited and recommended by Harry K. Hartness, a member, November 6, 1908, and a further application for additional protection May 3, 1911. These were sent by mail from Kalispel, Montana, where both individuals resided. Notices were regularly mailed to Benn at his home address, and he paid dues and assessments in the ordinary course. It does not appear that there was anything <span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> unusual or irregular in the proofs of death or the report of attending physician. Without further investigation and upon unsolicited information received through the mail, the Association declined to pay.</p>\n<p>Respondent claims that the facts show petitioner was doing business in Montana and the insurance contract was made and payable there. And it is said this contention is supported by <i>Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co.</i> v. <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94983\"><a href=\"/opinion/94983/connecticut-mut-life-ins-co-v-spratley/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Spratley,</span> supra</a></span></i><i>,</i> and <i>Pennsylvania Lumbermen's Mutual Fire Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96259\"><a href=\"/opinion/96259/pennsylvania-lumbermens-mut-fire-ins-co-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Considering all the circumstances, it seems sufficiently clear that the agreement incident to membership is a Minnesota contract, there made and to be performed.</p>\n<p>The Montana court was without jurisdiction unless petitioner by doing business in the State impliedly assented that process might be served upon the Secretary of State as its agent. \"If an insurance corporation of another State transacts business in Pennsylvania without complying with its provisions it will be deemed to have assented to any valid terms prescribed by that Commonwealth as a condition of its right to do business there; and it will be estopped to say that it had not done what it should have done in order that it might lawfully enter that Commonwealth and there exert its corporate powers.\" <i>Old Wayne Mutual Life Association</i> v. <i>McDonough,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96557\"><a href=\"/opinion/96557/old-wayne-mut-life-assn-of-indianapolis-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 21.</p>\n<p>The circumstances chiefly relied on to show that petitioner was doing business in Montana are these: The insured was asked to send in his application, upon a form furnished by the Association, by Hartness, one of its members and a resident of Montana, who with other members had been requested to procure such applications. The form was filled and signed in Montana and then sent to Minneapolis with the requisite fee. It was accepted and certificate of membership mailed to the applicant. After customary notices from the Association, with which blank applications for new members were commonly enclosed, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> the insured sent dues and assessments from his home in Montana to Minneapolis by mail and received receipts  all according to the usual method. Other members of the Association resided at Kalispel. The Association reserved the right to investigate all claims for sickness, accident or death.</p>\n<p>Considering what this Court held in <i>Green</i> v. <i>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Ry. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span>; <i>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Ry.

That is not enough \"to warrant the inference that the corporation has subjected itself to the local jurisdiction, and is by its duly authorized officers or agents present within the State or district where service is attempted.\" <i>People's Tobacco Co.</i> v. <i>American Tobacco <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span>,</i> 87.</p>\n<p>It also seems sufficiently clear from <i>Allgeyer</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94631\"><a href=\"/opinion/94631/allgeyer-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span>; <i>Hunter</i> v. <i>Mutual Reserve Life Insurance <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Co.,</span> supra</span></i><i>,</i> and <i>Provident Savings Life Assurance Society</i> v. <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98557\"><a href=\"/opinion/98557/provident-sav-life-assurance-soc-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Kentucky,</span> supra</a></span></i><i>,</i> that an insurance corporation is not doing business within a State merely because it insures lives of persons living therein, mails notices addressed to beneficiaries at their homes and pays losses by checks from its home office. See also <i>Pembleton</i> v. <i>Illinois Commercial Men's Association,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></span>.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the record fails to disclose any evidence sufficient to show that petitioner was doing business in Montana within the proper meaning of those words, and that the court there lacked jurisdiction to award the challenged judgment.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",
