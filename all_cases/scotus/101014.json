Individual passenger rates to the public during that time were in force, and in addition certain party rates open to the public, by which 10 or more passengers were entitled to reduced rates. Some of the rate tariffs provided for cash payments when tickets were issued, and that there should be no land grant deductions made from such party rates. In other tariffs no such provisions were made. As initial carrier, appellant presented its bills on proper forms to the disbursing officers of the government. In some of the bills individual rates with land grant deductions were charged, where 10 or more persons had been transported in troop movement; and in others party rates without land grant deductions were charged, depending upon which was the lower rate. The accounting officers of the government in all these cases applied party rates with land grant deductions.
