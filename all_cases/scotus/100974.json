The court held the heirs of Garland-No. 42-were not entitled to recover anything, and dismissed their petition. It rendered judgment for $3,113.90 in favor of Pitchlynn's heirs-No. 43.

By dismissing the petition of Garland's heirs, it adjudged, in effect, that he had received full compensation; and the judgment in favor of Pitchlynn's heirs for $3,113.92 determined that the amount theretofore received plus such recovery would amount to full compensation for his services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the findings of fact sufficient to permit us to dispose of the causes, and accordingly deny the motion to remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The enabling acts very cleary provide for recoveries upon the principle of quantum meruit for services rendered and expenses incurred.
