Claiming a preference, respondent, her administrator, refused the receiver's offer of a general claim against the estate and brought suit. Upon a directed verdict the administrator obtained judgment as a preferred creditor. The court was of opinion 'that the assets of the bank were augmented when the bank received from its customer the price agreed upon for said bonds and, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to participate in the distribution of the assets of the defendant bank as a preferred creditor.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed with an opinion which states: 'With the District Judge, we think that the proceeds of these bonds augmented the assets of the bank.

In Old Company's Lehigh, Inc., v. Meeker, Receiver, et al., supra, 294 U.S. 227, at page 229, 55 S.Ct. 392, 393, 79 L.Ed. 876, we asserted: 'What was done by the Mamaroneck bank on January 14, 1933, did not involve in its doing the creation of a special deposit or an augmentation of the assets. What was done had no effect except to diminish liabilities by reducing the indebtedness due to a depositor.' And Adams, Receiver, v. Champion, Trustee in Bankruptcy, supra, denied preference in respect of so much of a bank credit arising from the wrongful disposal of bonds as had been withdrawn prior to the receivership. Only the balance came to the receiver. We said (294 U.S. 231, 239, 55 S.Ct. 399, 402, 79 L.Ed. 880): 'Evidence is lacking that it was withdrawn in such a form or for such purposes as to be represented by any assets forming part of the estate today.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent was not entitled to a preference.
