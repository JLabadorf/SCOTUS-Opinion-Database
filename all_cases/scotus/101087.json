'We therefore hold, under the facts in this case, that      the defendants may not treat the gross proceeds of      plaintiff's sales outside the state as the worth of its gas      within the state, but that they may enforce the act upon the      value hereof within the state, and before it enters      interstate commerce.  The injunction herein will be      accordingly so modified.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The final order directed:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the decree of the circuit court of Kanawha county,      pronounced in this cause on the 25th day of May, 1926, in so      far and in so far only as it enjoins the defendants from      enforcing against the plaintiff the provisions of section 2a      * * * by imposing a tax upon the natural gas produced by the      plaintiff, based upon the value thereof within the state and      before it enters interstate commerce, be and the same hereby      is modified and corrected so as to permit defendants to      impose and enforce against the plaintiff a tax, under said      section, upon the natural gas so produced by it, based upon      the value thereof within the state and before it enters upon      interstate commerce, and that in all other respects said      decree is hereby modified and corrected be and the same      hereby is affirmed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chief business of plaintiff in error is production and purchase of natural gas in West Virginia and the continuous and uninterrupted transportation of this through pipe lines into Pennsylvania and Ohio, where it is sold, delivered and consumed. The corporation owns 3,178 producing wells located in 25 counties of West Virginia, from which it took in the year ending June 30, 1925, more than 23,000,000,000 cubic feet of gas. And during the same period it purchased from other producers more than 25,000,000,000 cubic feet.

Ct. 526, 67 L. Ed. 929. But they insist that, accepting the statute under consideration as construed by the highest court of the state, plaintiff in error will be subjected to an unlawful direct tax upon gross receipts derived from interstate commerce. This argument rests chiefly upon certain language excerpted from the opinion below. But we review the final decree and must accept the statute as authoritatively construed and applied. The plain result of the opinion and final decree is to require that the tax be computed upon the value of the gas at the well, and not otherwise. If, hereafter, executive officers disregard the approved construction and fix values upon any improper basis appropriate relief may be obtained through the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion concerning deprivation of due process goes upon the assumption that the imposition is upon gross receipts from interstate commerce, in reality upon property beyond the state's jurisdiction.

The true meanof the statute and the thing actually taxed oppose the first assertion. We cannot say that the Legislature acted either arbitrarily or unreasonably by authorizing the deduction. Nothing indicates a purpose to extend different treatment to those of the same class; no actual unreasonable inequality has been shown. Plaintiff in error is permitted to deduct $10,000; the same privilege, and nothing more, is extended to all other producers. Lake Superior Mines v. Lord, 271 U. S. 577, 46 S. Ct. 627, 70 L.

The true meaning of the statute and the thing actually taxed oppose the first assertion. We cannot say that the Legislature acted either arbitrarily or unreasonably by authorizing the deduction. Nothing indicates a purpose to extend different treatment to those of the same class; no actual unreasonable inequality has been shown. Plaintiff in error is permitted to deduct ten thousand dollars; the same privilege, and nothing more, is extended to all other producers. <i>Lake Superior Mines</i> v. <i>Lord,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100913\"><a href=\"/opinion/100913/lake-superior-consol-iron-mines-v-lord/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span>; <i>Swiss Oil Corporation</i> v. <i>Shanks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101027\"><a href=\"/opinion/101027/swiss-oil-co-v-shanks/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   An Act to provide for the raising of additional public revenue by a tax upon the privilege of engaging in certain occupations; to provide for the ascertainment, assessment, and collection of such tax; to provide penalties for violations of the terms hereof; and to repeal certain statutes, [passed by the Legislature of West Virginia June 5, 1925].\n</p>\n<p>Sec. 2. That from and after the thirtieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred twenty-five, there is hereby levied and shall be collected annual privilege taxes against the persons, on account of the business activities, and in the amounts to be determined by the application of rates against values or gross income, as the case may, as follows:</p>\n<p>Sec. 2-a. Upon every person engaging or continuing within this state in the business of mining and producing for sale, profit, or use, any coal, oil, natural gas, limestone, sand or other mineral product, or felling and producing timber for sale, profit, or use, the amounts of such tax to be equal to the value of the articles produced as shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the producer (except as hereinafter provided), multiplied by the respective rates as follows: coal, forty-two one-hundredths of one per cent.; oil, one per cent.; natural gas, one and seventeen-twentieths of one per cent.; limestone, sand or other mineral product, nine-twentieths of one per cent. The measure of this tax is the value of the entire production in this state, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the state.</p>\n<p>. . . .</p>\n<p>Sec. 2-h. In computing the amount of tax levied hereunder, however, for any year, there shall be deducted from the values, or from the gross income of the business, as the case may be, an exemption of ten thousand dollars of the amount of such values or gross income. Every person exercising any privilege taxable hereunder for any fractional part of a tax year shall be entitled to an exemption of that part of the sum of ten thousand dollars which bears the same proportion of the total sum that the period of time during which such person is engaged in such business bears to a whole year.</p>\n\n</div>",
