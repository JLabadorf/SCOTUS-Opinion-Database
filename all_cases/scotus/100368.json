Erickson in the sum of $56,670.35, and against the United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company in the sum of $56,670.35; the ground of recovery being alleged breaches of certain contracts entered into between the Spruce Corporation and Erickson for the sale of certain logs belonging to the Spruce Corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a motion to strike out certain allegations of the complaint, and, being overruled, the complaint was demurred to. It and the motion to strike out were upon the ground that it appeared upon the face of the complaint that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action. The demurrer was overruled. An answer was then filed, and a reply thereto. In the answer there was also a denial of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the issues thus made a jury was impaneled to try, which rendered a verdict, fixing the recovery against Erickson at $45,710.70, and against the Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company in the sum of $20,000.

The certificate recited that on the motion to strike out and upon the demurrer the defendants raised the question of the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court to hear and determine the cause, 'and asserted that the United States of America was neither a necessary nor proper party to the said action'; it being one 'founded on contract between a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Washington on the one part and a citizen and resident of the state of Washington on the other part, the said court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the same, but this court in consideration of the allegations and facts' of the complaint 'was of the opinion that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even a summary of the facts of the certificate would be somewhat long.

In other words, the question of jurisdiction is alone before us for decision, and, the letter of the complaint being regarded, there is no doubt of the jurisdiction of the court, for the first subdivision of section 24, of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. &#167; 991) expressly gives the District Court jurisdiction of suits brought by the United States. This is such a suit. The United States is one of the plaintiffs and joined in the suit by way of asserting and seeking to enforce a right in whcih it claims to have a direct and legal interest. Judged by the complaint, the claim made by the United States is not frivolous or wholly without support but is real and substantial. In other words, it calls for consideration and determination. This involves an exercise of jurisdiction, whether the ultimate decision sustains or rejects the claim. Jurisdiction is power to decide the case either way, as the merits may require. The Fair v.
