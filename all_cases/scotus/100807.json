St. Ann.

To show a cause of action it was necessary that the petition state distinctly the particular acts of fraud and coercion relied on, specifying by whom and in what manner they were perpetrated, with such definiteness and reasonable certainty that the court might see that, if proved, they would warrant the setting aside of the settlement. See Stearns v. Page, 7 How. 819, 829, 12 L. Ed. 928; Perkins-Campbell Co. v. United States, 44 S. Ct. 237, 264 U. S. 213, 218, 68 L. Ed. 643; Cairo Railroad v. United States, 45 S. Ct. 247, 267 U. S. 350, 352, 69 L. Ed. 651. The petition contained no such specific allegations, and since its vague and general averments did not overcome the effect of the release, the demurrer was properly sustained.
