The application was presented to Mr. Justice REED, and by him referred to the full Court. Cf. Budlong v. Budlong, 296 U.S. 550, 56 S.Ct. 245, 80 L.Ed. 389; Brown v.

He now contends that, in addition to the appellate review which he has already obtained, he is entitled to an appeal as of right from the district court directly to this Court, in view of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 681, 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 681, which in terms authorizes such an appeal 'in all cases of conviction of crime the punish ment of which provided by law is death, tried before any court of the United States'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This section of the Code has its origin in &#167; 6 of the Act of February 6, 1889, 25 Stat. 655, 656, which granted a writ of error as of right from this Court to any federal trial court 'in all cases of conviction of crime the punishment of which provided by law is death'. This provision preceded the creation of circuit courts of appeals by the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826. See United States v. Rider, 163 U.S. 132, 138, 16 S.Ct. 983, 41 L.Ed. 101. Section 5 of the latter Act provided that appeals be taken from district courts (or the existing circuit courts) directly to this Court in six specified classes of cases, one of which was 'In cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous crime'; and by &#167; 6 it was provided that the circuit courts of appeals should exercise appellate jurisdiction 'in all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section of this act, unless otherwise provided by law'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act of January 20, 1897, 29 Stat. 492, withdrew from this Court and transferred to the circuit courts of appeals appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases not capital. This was accomplished by deleting, from the clause of &#167; 5 of the Act of March 3, 1891, just quoted, the phrase 'or otherwise infamous', so that the direct appeal to this Court was preserved only 'in cases of conviction of a capital crime'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5 remained in that form until the enactment of the Judicial Code. Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1087. Section 238 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1157, which in connection with &#167; 236, 36 Stat. 1156, defined the jurisdiction of this Court on direct appeals from district courts, set forth the substance of &#167; 5 of the Act of March 3, 1891, except that it omitted the clause providing for appeals from the trial court to this Court 'in cases of conviction of a capital crime'. This omission was not accidental, but deliberate, and its purpose was to withdraw the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain a direct appeal from a district court in a capital case. This may be seen from the notes of the Revisers, which state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The only change made in the section is in striking out the words 'in cases of conviction of a capital crime.'

And &#167; 297 directed, 36 Stat. 1169, that 'all other Acts and parts of Acts, in so far as they are embraced within and superseded by this Act, are hereby repealed'.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a plain purpose, established both by language of the Judicial Code and its legislative history, cannot be ignored.

Taylor, 210 U.S. 281, 292, 28 S.Ct. 616, 619, 53 L.Ed. 1061) and it is evident that since 1911 the statutes have not authorized a direct appeal to this Court in capital cases. The fact that the words of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 681 have lingered on in the successive editions of the United States Code is immaterial. By 1 U.S.C. &#167; 54(a), 1 U.S.C.A. &#167; 54(a) the Code establishes 'prima facie' the laws of the United States. But the very meaning of 'prima facie' is that the Code cannot prevail over the Statutes at Large when the two are inconsistent. Cf. Warner v.
