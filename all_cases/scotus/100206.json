That law gives a summary suit in which, speaking broadly, no defence is open except payment, Mortgage Law Regulations, Art. 175; and it is contended that this deprives the plaintiffs, appellants,) of their property without due process of law. The statutes give a separate action to annul the mortgage in which any defense to it may be set up, and also provided for a cautionary notice, Mortgage Law, Art. 42; Mortgage Law Regulations, Art. 91, which the Supreme Court of Porto Rico regards as a sufficient substitute for an injunction. American Trading Co. v. Monserrat, 18 Porto Rico, 268. See Romeu v. Todd, 206 U. S. 358, 27 Sup. Ct. 724, 51 L. Ed. 1093. The bill was dismissed by the District Court for want of jurisdiction.
