West Virginia, 217 U. S. 577, 585, 30 Sup. Ct. 630, 632 (54, L.

The      object to be obtained is the settlement of a boundary line      between sovereign states in the interest, not only of      property rights, but also in promotion of the peace and good      order of the communities, and is one which the states have a      common interest to bring to a satisfactory and final      conclusion. Where such is the nature of the cause we think      the expenses should be borne in common, so far as may be, and      we therefore adopt so much of the decree proposed by the      state of Maryland as makes provision for the costs of the      surveys made under the orders of this court.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same rule, however, does not apply to cases in which the parties have a litigious interest. In New Hampshire v. Louisiana, and New York v. Louisana, 108 U. S. 76, 91, 2 Sup. Ct. 176, 27 L. Ed. 656, the complainant states brought suits upon bonds of Louisiana assigned to them by their citizens for the purpose of avoiding the inhibition of the Eleventh Amendment. The suits were dismissed, with costs adjudged against the complainants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sough Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286, 321, 24 Sup. Ct. 269, 48 L. Ed. 448, the suit was on bonds of North Carolina donated by the original purchasers to South Dakota, and there was judgment for South Dakota for the amount due, with costs of suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Missouri v. Illinois, 200 U. S. 496, 26 Sup. Ct. 268, 50 L. Ed. 572, which was a bill to restrain Illinois and her subordinate agency, the Chicago Sanitary District, from discharging sewage into the Mississippi and exposing the people of Missouri to danger of typhoid fever from germs in their drinking water, the bill was dismissed without prejudice, but the costs were adjudged against the complainant state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In New York v. New Jersey, 256 U. S. 296, 313, 41 Sup. Ct. 492, 65 L. Ed. 937, the bill sought to restrain the pollution of the harbor of New York.

Colorado, 206 U. S. 46, 117, 27 Sup. Ct. 655, 51 L. Ed. 956, the suit was brought to enjoin diversion of flowing water. Apparently the court regarded the issue as a nonlitigious one, the settlement of which would be useful to both states, and, following the boundary cases, divided the costs. In Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U. S. 496, 42 Sup. Ct. 594; Id., 260 U. S. 1, 3, 43 Sup. Ct. 2, 66 L.

The persons whose lands were overflowed raised a fund to conduct the litigation. The bill of North Dakota asked for a decree of injunction with $5,000 for damages to state property and $1,000,000 for damages to residents of North Dakota, with the purpose, presumably, of distributing the latter sum to injured residents, contributors to the fund. The exact agreement as to the use of the funds thus raised does not appear in the record. When the state engineer of North Dakota, Mr. Ralph, the chief witness for the state, was cross-examined in respect to it, he refused to answer by advice of counsel for North Dakota. The natural inference is that the fund was being used in the conduct of the litigation. We think that the circumstances put this case in the category with New Hampshire v. Louisiana, Missouri v. Illinois, and New York v. New Jersey, and that the costs should be taxed against North Dakota, the defeated party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rhode Island v.
