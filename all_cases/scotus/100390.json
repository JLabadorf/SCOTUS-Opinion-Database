The owners appeared as claimants. Excepting to the libel, they prayed that, 'in so far as the action is either in rem or in personam for salvage and in rem for damage,' it be dismissed for want of admiralty jurisdiction. The court maintained the exception, entered a decree of dismissal precisely as prayed for, and allowed an appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp.
