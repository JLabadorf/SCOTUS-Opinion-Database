Appellees' demurrer went upon the ground, among others, that the provisions of the statute and the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture to which the count referred are void (United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 56 S.Ct. 312, 80 L.Ed. 477, 102 A.L.R. 914) and that the acts set forth in the indictment do not constitute an offense against the laws of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The false claims statute under which the prosecution was brought penalizes one who 'for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States * * * shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations.' Criminal Code, &#167; 35, 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 80.

Appellees contend that, if any statute was construed, it was not the statute on which the indictment is founded and hence that this Court has no jurisdiction. The point is that the indictment charged a conspiracy under Criminal Code, &#167; 37 (18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 88). But the conspiracy charged is one to violate the false claims statute, Criminal Code, &#167; 35 (18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 80). In similar cases the jurisdiction of this Court has been sustained. The statute, at the violation of which the conspiracy is aimed, has been treated as the statute upon which the indictment is founded within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act. United States v. Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, 95, 43 S.Ct. 39, 40, 67 L.Ed. 149; United States v. Walter, 263 U.S. 15, 16, 17, 44 S.Ct. 10, 11, 68 L.Ed. 137. See, also, United States v. Keitel, 211 U.S. 370, 387, 29 S.Ct. 123, 53 L.Ed. 230.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Appellees contend that the court below construed the indictment and not the statute. United States v. Colgate &amp; Co., 250 U.S. 300, 306, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992, 7 A.L.R. 443; United States v. Hastings, 296 U.S. 188, 192, 56 S.Ct. 218, 219, 80 L.Ed. 148. The argument is that a conspiracy to violate section 35 must involve a pecuniary fraud. United States v. Cohn, 270 U.S. 339, 345, 346, 46 S.Ct. 251, 252, 253, 70 L.Ed. 616. In that view appellees urge that the court below has simply ruled that there was no pecuniary loss under the facts alleged. But the District Court found no flaw in the indictment as a pleading. Nor does the court appear to have considered the question of pecuniary loss. The court rested its decision upon the point that the facts alleged in the indictment with respect to the identity of the producers of the hogs, or the sources from which the hogs originated, had ceased to be material because of the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. This did not purport to be a construction of the indictment but a ruling that the indictment in view of the invalidity of that act failed to state an offense. The substance of the decision thus appears to be that the false claims statute does not apply to an attempt to defraud the United States by obtaining the approval of claims and benefit payments through false representations, if the statute providing for such claims and payments is found to be invalid. That is clearly a construction of the statute. United States v. Patten, 226 U.S. 525, 535, 33 S.Ct. 141, 57 L.Ed. 333, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 325; United States v. Birdsall, 233 U.S. 223, 230, 34 S.Ct. 512, 58 L.Ed. 930.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Such a construction is inadmissible. It might as well be said that one could embezzle moneys in the United States Treasury with impunity if it turns out that they were collected in the course of invalid transactions. See Madden v. United States (C.C.A.) 80 F.2d 672, 674. Appellees were not indicted for a conspiracy to violate the Agricultural Adjustment Act but for a conspiracy to violate the statute protecting the United States against frauds. It is cheating the government at which the statute aims and Congress was entitled to protect the government against those who would swindle it regardless of questions of constitutional authority as to the operations that the government is conducting. Such questions cannot be raised by those who make false claims against the government. See Langer v. United States (C.C.A.) 76 F.2d 817, 824, 825; Madden v. United States, supra; United States v. Harding, 65 App.D.C. 161, 81 F.2d 563, 568; United States v.
