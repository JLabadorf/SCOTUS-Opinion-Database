The company had outstanding but two classes of stock, voting common of a par value of $397,471.25 and non-voting common of a par value of $819,333.06. The dividend was of non-voting common of a par of $121,680.43 and was distributed to holders of the voting and non-voting common. The fair market value of the stock distributed as a dividend was its par value and the earnings or profits available for distribution were in excess of its total value.
