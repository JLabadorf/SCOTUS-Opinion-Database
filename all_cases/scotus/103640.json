It prayed treble damages 'in accordance with the provisions of the Trademark Law of 1905', 15 U.S.C.A. &#167; 96, and was amended to allege registration of a second wrapper design in the Patent Office under the No. 46862.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decree for petitioner, D.C., 36 F.Supp. 730, was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 122 F.2d 318.
