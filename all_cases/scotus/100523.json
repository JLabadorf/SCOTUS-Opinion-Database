It is engaged in New York in the business of exporting, which is defined to be the purchase of personal property within the United States, and the sale thereof without the United States, and has under the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227) been required to pay an income tax on its net income, part of which is derived from such foreign business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time and times there were foreign corporations engaged in like business of buying personal property within the United States and exporting and selling it without the United States.

St. Ann. Supp. 1923, &#167;&#167; 5949, 5949a), and that no part of the claim had been remitted or repaid to plaintiff, or to any one, for its account.

And as the government further points out, the foreign corporation must look to the country of its origin for protection against injury and redress of losses occurring in that and other foreign countries, and not to the United States. The government, therefore, contends, and rightly contends, that domestic corporations are required to pay a tax on their incomes from all sources while foreign corporations are taxed only on their income from sources within the United States because, to repeat, only that income is earned under the protection of American laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And we understand a further contention to be that the discrimination is the fact that makes the tax on plaintiff a direct burden on and impediment to its business of exporting, 'in violation of paragraph 5 of section 9 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.\" The alleged discrimination is said in some way to emphasize and increase the violation of that paragraph of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as the invocation of paragraph 5 depends upon discrimination, what we have said disposes of it; if it be independent of discrimination and based upon the fact of a tax upon exports, it is completely answered and disposed of adversely by Peck &amp; Co. v.
