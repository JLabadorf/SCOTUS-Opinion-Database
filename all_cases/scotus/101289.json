The order was upheld by the trial court and by the Supreme Court of the state. 141 Wash. 172, 251 P. 130. The cases are here on writs of error sued out under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code (28 USCA &#167; 344(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order is a statute of the state within the meaning of that section, and therefore our jurisdiction is invoked in the right mode.

The men are employed in the booming work. The plaintiff in the other suit conducts a sawmill on the bank of a navigable river. Logs are towed in booms to a point adjacent to the mill, and then anchored. The booms afterwards are taken apart, and the logs are guided to a conveyor extending into the river, and then drawn into the mill for sawing. The men are employed in taking apart the booms and guiding the logs to the conveyor.

King Manufacturing Co. v. City Council of Augusta, 277 U. S. 100, 48 S. Ct. 489, 72 L. Ed. &#8212;, decided this day, Mr. Justice HOLMES and I think that the writs of error in these cases also should be dismissed. Treating these writs of error as petitions for certiorari (see Gaines v. Washington, 277 U. S. 81, 48 S. Ct. 468, 72 L. Ed. 793, decided this day), we think that the petitions should be denied. The trivial character of the questions presented illustrates again the wisdom of not granting, in cases involving the orders of administrative boards, a review as of right-with its attendant right to oral argument. It is true that each of these cases presents a question involving the Federal Constitution. But in both the controlling principle is well settled, and the question presented is simply whether on the particular facts it is applicable. Obviously such a question is of no general importance. The number of administrative boards, state and municipal, with like power to issue orders is now very large. Each board issues many orders. And each order may, by its application to varying facts, give rise to many distinct constitutional questions. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U. S. 282, 42 S. Ct. 106, 66 L.
