That provision contemplates the employment of this writ in instances not covered by section 240 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C. &#167; 347 (28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 347)), and affords ample authority for using the writ as an auxiliary process and as a means 'of giving full force and effect to existing appellate authority and of furthering justice in other kindred ways.'

It appears that the principal property of the debtor, the 620 Church Street Building Corporation, consists of certain leaseholds and improvements known as the Carlson Building Annex. The allowed claims include first mortgage bonds of $445,500 upon which interest is due from January, 1931, second mortgage notes for $40,250, with interest from December, 1929, and a third mortgage note for $27,000, with interest from December, 1931.

Petitioners insist that their consent to the plan of reorganization was necessary or that their claims should have been accorded 'adequate protection.' But the adequate protection to which the statute refers is 'for the realization of the value of the interests, claims or liens' affected. Here the controlling finding is not only that there was no equity in the property above the first mortgage, but that petitioners' claims were appraised by the court as having 'no value.' There was no value to be protected. This finding embraces whatever interests petitioners may have as junior lienors under the Illinois law, and, in the same aspect, the constitutional argument is unavailing as petitioners have not shown injury.
