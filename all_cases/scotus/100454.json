St. Ann. Supp. 1923, &#167; 10138 1/4 a et seq.), authorizing the plaintiffs, who are licensed pharmacists conducting a general drug business in San Francisco, to use and sell in such business intoxicating liquors for other than beverage purposes. The District Court dismissed the bill as not stating a cause of action, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree on the ground that the suit could not be maintained without making the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a party defendant. 277 Fed. 632. The plaintiffs prosecute this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">National Prohibition Act, c. 85, tit. 2, 41 Stat. 307, commits its administration to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, authorizes him to prescribe regulations for carrying out its provisions, and declares, in clause 7 of section 1, that any act authorized to be done by the Commissioner 'may be performed by any assistant or agent designated by him for that purpose.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act directly prohibits the manufacture, sale, etc., of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, and further provides in section 3, that liquor for nonbeverage purposes may be manufactured, purchased, sold, etc., 'but only as herein provided,' and, in section 6, that no one shall manufacture, sell, purchase, etc., any liquor 'without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner so to do'; that no permit shall be issued to any one to sell at retail, unless the selling is to be through a pharmacist designated in the permit and licensed under the state law to compound and dispense medicine under a physician's prescription; that every permit shall be 'signed by the Commissioner or his authorized agent' and shall 'designate and limit the acts that are permitted'; that the Commissioner 'shall prescribe the form of all permits,' and that where he refuses a permit the applicant 'may have a review of his decision before a court of equity.' The regulations prescribed provide for and designate a general agent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, called a prohibition commissioner, who is authorized, among other things, to issue and sign permits to sell liquor at retail for medicinal purposes through licensed pharmacists, and also a local agent in each state or district, called a prohibition director, who is authorized, among other things, to issue and sign permits to purchase liquor to be used and sold under the permits last mentioned. The regulations further contain a provision that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Every permit will clearly and specifically designate and      limit the acts that are permitted and the time when and the      place where such acts may be performed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The permit held by the plaintiffs was issued and signed by the prohibition commissioner, and the restriction therein of which the plaintiffs complain says 'this permit is issued for 100 gallons of distilled spirits and 5 gallons of wine per quarterly period.' The director adhered to the restriction by refusing to give the plaintiffs permits to purchase in excess of those quantities. The plaintiffs allege that the restriction was put in the permit without any lawful authority; that, if it be authorized by the regulations, the latter are void; and that the director by giving effect to it is wrongfully subjecting the plaintiffs to irreparable injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act and the regulations make it plain that the prohibition commissioner and the prohibition director are mere agents and subordinates of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. They act under his direction and perform such acts only as he commits to them by the regulations. They are responsible to him and must abide by his direction. What they do is as if done by him. He is the public's real representative in the matter, and, if the injunction were granted, his are the hands which would be tied. All this being so, he should have been made a party defendant&#8212;the principal one&#8212;and given opportunity to defend his direction and regulations. Litchfield v. Register and Receiver, 9 Wall. 575, 578, 19 L. Ed. 681; Plested v. Abbey, 228 U. S. 42, 50, 51, 33 Sup. Ct. 503, 57 L. Ed. 724. In principle, Warner Valley Stock Co. v. Smith, 165 U. S. 28, 17 Sup. Ct. 225, 41 L. Ed. 621, is well in point. There an injunction was sought against the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office to prevent them from giving effect to prior orders of the Secretary alleged to be outside his powers and hurtful to the plaintiff. While the suit was pending the Secretary resigned his office and there was at that time no way of bringing his successor into the suit. So the question arose whether it could be continued against the Commissioner alone. The answer was in the negative; the court saying (165 U. S. 34, 17 Sup. Ct. 228, 41 L. Ed. 621):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The purpose of the bill was to control the action of the      Secretary of the Interior; the principal relief sought was      against him; and the relief asked against the Commissioner of      the General Land Office was only incidental, and by way of      restraining him from executing the orders of his official      head. To maintain such a bill against the subordinate officer      alone, without joining his superior, whose acts are alleged      to have been unlawful, would be contrary to settled rules of      equity pleading.
