The large mass of business now before Congress growing out of private claims consumes its time year after year in committee work, rendered useless by the lack of time to consider and pass upon them.

This Act not only expanded the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, but, for the first time, gave District Courts general authority to hear and determine claims against the Government. Relief of existing claim congestion and prevention of future congestion obviously demanded an integrated jurisdictional plan by which the Court of Claims and District Courts could afford equal opportunities for expeditious and fair trials of like claims within the jurisdictional amount of the District Courts. The erection of barriers to recovery in the District Courts which did not exist in the Court of Claims would have tended to defeat the prime objectives of the Act. Uniformity and equality in substantial rights and privileges&#8212;for claimants in both forums&#8212;were essential features in the system. Distinctions between the opportunities for recovery afforded in the two forums would have tended to mar the symmetry of the plan and to impair its effective and successful operation. As to substantial rights, Congress evidently meant to give claimants an identical status in both Courts where the amount in controversy was included in the jurisdiction of both. We find no support in the background or objective of the Act for a construction under which a claimant's rights would be preserved by filing a petition in the Court of Claims, but would be lost without additional action&#8212;in the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said by this Court in United States v.

It is needless to say more than has already been intimated as to the general policy of this legislation. The large mass of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*571</span> business now before Congress growing out of private claims consumes its time year after year in committee work, rendered useless by the lack of time to consider and pass upon them. Just claims are painfully deferred without interest, and the credit of the Government, so strictly upheld upon its bonded debt, is justly censured in respect to its honest private claims.\"<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>In response to the needs disclosed by this report Congress passed the Tucker Act, manifestly intending to provide adequate opportunity for expeditious and orderly determination of claims against the Government. This Act not only expanded the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, but, for the first time, gave District Courts general authority to hear and determine claims against the Government. Relief of existing claim congestion and prevention of future congestion obviously demanded an integrated jurisdictional plan by which the Court of Claims and District Courts could afford equal opportunities for expeditious and fair trials of like claims within the jurisdictional amount of the District Courts. The erection of barriers to recovery in the District Courts which did not exist in the Court of Claims would have tended to defeat the prime objectives of the Act. Uniformity and equality in substantial rights and privileges  for claimants in both forums  were essential features in the system. Distinctions between the opportunities for recovery afforded in the two forums would have tended to mar the symmetry of the plan and to impair its effective and successful operation. As to substantial rights, Congress evidently meant to give claimants an identical status in both Courts where the amount in controversy was included in the jurisdiction of both. We find no support in the background or objective of the Act for a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> construction under which a claimant's rights would be preserved by filing a petition in the Court of Claims, but would be lost  without additional action  in the District Court.</p>\n<p>As said by this Court in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Greathouse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94677\"><a href=\"/opinion/94677/united-states-v-greathouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 606:</p>\n<p>\". . . it was not contemplated that the limitation upon suits against the Government in the District . . . Courts of the United States should be different from that applicable to like suits in the Court of Claims.\"</p>\n<p>As used in this statute the word \"begun\" should be given its ordinary and accustomed meaning. To begin is to start; to institute; to initiate; to commence. This suit was begun  within two years after the refund claim was disallowed  when the petition was filed in court in good faith. Notice was mailed the Attorney General and the District Attorney was promptly served  both within four days after the verified petition was filed. Under these circumstances, we do not consider what would be the effect of lack of diligence in obtaining service.<sup>[11]</sup> The judgment in the court below was not in harmony with the views here expressed and is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
