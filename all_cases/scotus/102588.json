This will extend Federal jurisdiction under the act to persons who have been kidnaped and held, not only for reward, but for any other reason, except that a kidnaping by a parent of his child is specifically exempted. . . .\" H. Rep. 1457, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., May 3, 1934.</p>\n<p>Evidently, Congress intended to prevent transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of persons who were being unlawfully restrained in order that the captor might secure some benefit to himself. And this is adequately expressed by the words of the enactment.</p>\n<p>The rule of <i>ejusdem generis,</i> while firmly established, is only an instrumentality for ascertaining the correct meaning of words when there is uncertainty. Ordinarily, it limits general terms which follow specific ones to matters similar to those specified; but it may not be used to defeat the obvious purpose of legislation. And, while penal statutes are narrowly construed, this does not require rejection of that sense of the words which best harmonizes with the context and the end in view. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hartwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87930\"><a href=\"/opinion/87930/united-states-v-hartwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 395; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Southern Pacific Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1-17</span></span>, 18; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Bitty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96784\"><a href=\"/opinion/96784/united-states-v-bitty/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 402; <i>United States</i> v. <i>Mescall,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">26-31</span></span>, 32.</p>\n<p>Holding an officer to prevent the captor's arrest is something done with the expectation of benefit to the transgressor. So also is kidnaping with purpose to secure money. These benefits, while not the same, are similar in their general nature and the desire to secure either of them may lead to kidnaping. If the word reward, as commonly understood, is not itself broad enough to include benefits expected to follow the prevention of an arrest, they fall within the broad term, \"otherwise.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> The words \"except, in case of a minor, by a parent thereof\" emphasize the intended result of the enactment. They indicate legislative understanding that in their absence a parent, who carried his child away because of affection, might subject himself to condemnation of the statute. <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85534\"><a href=\"/opinion/85534/brown-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 438.</p>\n<p>Both questions must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"The Committee on the Judiciary, having had under consideration the bill (S. 2252) to amend the act forbidding the transportation of kidnaped persons in interstate commerce, reports the same favorably to the Senate and recommends that the bill do pass.\n</p>\n<p>\"The purpose and need of this legislation are set out in the following memorandum from the Department of Justice:</p>\n<p>\"S. 2252; H.R. 6918: This is a bill to amend the act forbidding the transportation of kidnaped persons in interstate commerce  act of June 22, 1932 (U.S.C., ch. 271, title 18, sec. 408a), commonly known as the `Lindbergh Act.' This amendment adds thereto the word `otherwise' so that the act as amended reads: `Whoever shall knowingly transport . . . any person who shall have been unlawfully seized . . . and held for ransom or reward or otherwise shall, upon conviction, be punished . . .' The object of the addition of the word `otherwise' is to extend the jurisdiction of this act to persons who have been kidnaped and held, not only for reward, but for any other reason.</p>\n<p>\"In addition, this bill adds a proviso to the Lindbergh Act to the effect that in the absence of the return of the person kidnaped and in the absence of the apprehension of the kidnaper during a period of 3 days, the presumption arises that such person has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce, but such presumption is not conclusive.</p>\n<p>\"I believe that this is a sound amendment which will clear up border-line cases, justifying Federal investigation in most of such cases and assuring the validity of Federal prosecution in numerous instances in which such prosecution would be questionable under the present form of this act.\" S. Rep. 534, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., March 22, 1934.</p>\n\n</div>",
