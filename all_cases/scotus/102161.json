Leake became mentally incompetent by reason of his service in the Army during the World War. Since May, 1922, the United States government has paid compensation to his guardian at the rate of $100 a month in accordance with the provisions of part II of the World War Veterans' Act (38 U.S.C. &#167; 471 et seq. (38 USCA &#167; 471 et seq.)), and disability benefits at the rate of $57.50 a month under a policy of war risk insurance in accordance with the provisions of part III of the same act. 38 U.S.C. &#167; 511 et seq. (38 USCA &#167; 511 et seq.). On June 3, 1924, the guardian purchased land and buildings in Blount county, Tenn., paying therefor $2,500 in cash out of the moneys theretofore received from the government, $2,000 in promissory notes, which have been paid out of later moneys derived from the same source, and $1,500 by assuming the payment of a mortgage, which has been discharged by the use of the proceeds of fire insurance covering one of the buildings. State and county taxes assessed upon the land for the year 1929 are in arrears with interest and penalties. The state of Tennessee, the respondent here, brought suit in the chancery court to declare the tax a lien enforceable by a sale. The guardian and his ward answered that by force of the federal statutes the land was exempt. The chancellor sustained the defense and dismissed the complainant's bill. The Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed, and directed the court of chancery to award judgment to the state. State v. Blair, 165 Tenn. 519, 57 S.W.(2d) 455.
