The appellant received the car at Omaha, hauled it to Chicago, and there delivered it to the consignee without collecting the freight and other charges, which amounted to $683.79. Because of unreasonable delay on the part of appellant and its failure to use reasonable care to keep the car properly iced, the grapes were delivered in a damaged condition. Appellant sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California to recover such charges; and appellee by answer set up the loss. While claiming to have suffered damages of $1,011.70, he asked no affirmative relief, but only that the loss be held to be a set-off against appellant's claim. The court allowed the set-off.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court of Appeals, under section 239 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C., &#167; 346 (28 USCA &#167; 346) certified to this court the following question:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Where an interstate railroad carrier delivers to the      consignee at destination a consignment of freight without      collecting the transportation and other lawful charges and      thereafter brings an action at law to recover from the      shipper the amount thereof, in a United States court in a      district where the state law provides that if a defendant      omits to set up a counterclaim arising out of the transaction      constituting the foundation of the plaintiff's claim he      cannot thereafter maintain an action upon the same, and,      further, that where such cross-claims have existed 'the two      demands shall be deemed compensated,' is the shipper, acting      in good faith and without collusion, debarred by the      Interstate Commerce Acts, particularly the Hepburn Act (34      Stat. 587) from pleading, by way of set-off, a counterclaim      for a loss suffered by him as a result of the carrier's      failure to perform its obligations touching the      transportation and delivery of the identical shipment?'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant is liable to the appellee for damages in an amount at least equal to the charges sued for. 49 U.

And, unless the Hepburn Act stands in the way, the shipper has the right, under established practice in California, to set up his loss as a counterclaim. 28 U. S.

They are required to collect the established rates, charges, and fares from all alike in cash. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 31 S. Ct. 265, 55 L. Ed. 297, 34 L. R. A.

In the case last mentioned the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller, said (page 580 of 15 Wall., 21 L. Ed. 229): 'It would be a most pernicious doctrine to allow a citizen of a distant State to institute in these courts a suit against a citizen of the State where the court is held and escape the liability which the laws of the State have attached to all plaintiffs of allowing just and legal set-offs and counter claims to be interposed and tried in the same suit and in the same form.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The practice of determining claims of shippers for loss or damage in suits brought by carriers to collect transportation charges is not repugnant to the rule prohibiting the payment of such charges otherwise than in money.

But it is not suggested how opportunity for collusion in respect of such matters would be lessened by abolishing counterclaims in cases such as this. Collusion and fraud may be practiced in the defense and settlement of separate actions brought on such claims, as well as when the same matters are put forward as offsets or counterclaims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The act ought not to be construed to put aside state laws and long-established practice in respect of pleading unless the intention of Congress so to do is plain. There appears no reasonable probability that the relegation of shippers to separate actions for the enforcement of their claims for loss or damage would operate more effectively to enforce the purpose of Congress to prevent discrimination. There is no substantial ground upon which the act may be given the construction for which the carrier contends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question is answered 'No.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There are conflicting decisions on the question.

Neither is to be distinguished from payment in money.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> It is well understood that payment by carriers to shippers under the guise of settling claims for loss and damage may in effect constitute discrimination that the Act was intended to prevent. But it is not suggested how opportunity for collusion in respect of such matters would be lessened by abolishing counterclaims in cases such as this. Collusion and fraud may be practiced in the defense and settlement of separate actions brought on such claims as well as when the same matters are put forward as offsets or counterclaims.</p>\n<p>The Act ought not to be construed to put aside state laws and long established practice in respect of pleading unless the intention of Congress so to do is plain. There appears no reasonable probability that the relegation of shippers to separate actions for the enforcement of their claims for loss or damage would operate more effectively to enforce the purpose of Congress to prevent discrimination. There is no substantial ground upon which the Act may be given the construction for which the carrier contends.</p>\n<p>The question is answered</p>\n<p><i>No.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   There are conflicting decisions on the question.
