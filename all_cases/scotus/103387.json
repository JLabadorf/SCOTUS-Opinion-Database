Between November 5, 1933, and January 6, 1936, they exported to foreign countries large quantities of hog products with respect to which they paid processing taxes under Section 9(a) and floor stock taxes under Section 16(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 48 Stat. 31, 35, 40, 7 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 609(a), 616(a). Subsequent to exportation petitioners filed claims for refunds under Section 17(a). 48 Stat. 31, 40, 7 U.S.C.A. &#167; 617(a). The Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied all of the claims and suit in the Court of Claims followed. The United States thereupon moved to dismiss the petitions on the ground that the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction because of certain provisions of Title VII of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1747&#8212;1755, 7 U.S.C.A. &#167; 644 et seq. The Court of Claims dismissed the actions for want of jurisdiction, on the ground, however, that Section 601(e) of Title IV of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1740, 7 U.S.C.A. &#167; 641(e), prevented judicial review of the Commissioner's action. 30 F.Supp. 672. To resolve the conflict with Cudahy Bros. Co. v. LaBudde, 7 Cir., 92 F.2d 937, and Neuss, Hesslein &amp; Co., Inc., v.

It is true that Section 17(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act provided for these refunds before the Act was held unconstitutional in United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 56 S.Ct. 312, 80 L.Ed. 477, 102 A.L.R. 914. Whether petitioners could still establish refund claims under that section if the act had never been invalidated is a question we need not consider. For whatever the effect of that decision on Section 17(a), Congress expressly made it a part of Title IV by reenacting it in Section 601(a), 49 Stat. 1648, 1739.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> It follows that petitioners' claims, purportedly based on Section 17(a), must be governed by Title IV and the limitations it imposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 601(e) of Title IV provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The determination of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to any refund under this section shall be final and no court shall have jurisdiction to review such determination.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners contend that Congress intended to commit to the final determination of the Commissioner only 'such matters as findings of fact, computations, and the like'.
