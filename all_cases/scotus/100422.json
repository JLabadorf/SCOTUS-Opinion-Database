This is equally true whether the claim of immunity is contested because of the character of the defendant or because the immunity is alleged to have been waived. The question involved here is not that presented in The Pesaro, 255 U. S. 216. 41 Sup. Ct. 308, 65 L. Ed. 592, and The Carlo Poma, 255 U. S. 219, 41 Sup. Ct. 309, 65 L. Ed. 594. There, the question requiring decision was whether Congress had conferred upon the District Court sitting in admiralty power to entertain a suit against 'a general ship engaged in the common carriage of merchandise by water, for hire' which, at the time of the arrest, was owned by the Italian government and was in its possession. That question being one of the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court, the direct appeal was sustained in The Pesaro and the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals was ordered dismissed in The Carlo Poma. A related question was presented in The Sao Vicente, 260 U. S. 151, 43 Sup. Ct. 15, 67 L. Ed. 179 which was likewise a suit in admiralty There the writ of certiorari was dismissed.
