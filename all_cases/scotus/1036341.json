The\nCourt’s opinion approving the order concluded with what I\ndescribed as a “bizarre coda,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 12),\nwhich said that “[t]he State may wish to move for modifi-\ncation” of the injunction, and that the District Court “may\ngrant such a request provided that the State satisfies\nnecessary and appropriate preconditions,” ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted).

That was in my view\n“a compromise solution” that is “unknown in our legal\nsystem,” which does not permit appellate courts to pre-\nscribe in advance the exercise of district-court discretion.\nId., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 13, 14). I warned, moreover,\nthat “the judges of the District Court are likely to call [the\nCourt’s] bluff, since they know full well it cannot possibly\nbe an abuse of discretion to refuse to accept the State’s\nproposed modifications in an injunction that has just been\napproved (affirmed) in its present form.” Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14).\n   The bluff has been called, and the Court has nary a pair\nto lay on the table. The State, seeking to invoke the ex\nante appellate control of district-court discretion, and to\ncompel the modification decreed by the Court’s raised\neyebrow, provided evidence that it has made meaningful\nprogress and that population reductions to the level re-\nquired by the injunction are unnecessary. But the latter\nargument was made and rejected in the last round, and\nthe former hardly requires (demands) modification of the\ninjunction. It was predictable two Terms ago that the\nState would make progress—indeed, it promised to do so.\nIf the reality of incremental progress makes the injunction\nnow invalid, the probability (indeed, one might say the\ncertainty) of incremental progress made the injunction an\noverreach two Terms ago. Surely it is not the case that\nwhen a party subject to an injunction makes substantial\nprogress toward compliance it is an abuse of discretion not\nto revise the injunction.\n   But as I suggested in my dissent, perhaps the Court\nnever meant to follow through on its revision suggestions.\nPerhaps they were nothing more than “a ceremonial wash-\n\f                 Cite as: 570 U.
