S. 504, 46 S. Ct. 179, 70 L. Ed. 380 (January 11, 1926), the things done by the Rathbone Manufacturing Company amounted, in substance, to a voluntary assignment of all its property within the meaning of R. S. &#167; 3466 (Comp.

Consequently, if the Director General is entitled to the priority granted to the United States by that section, the judgment below must be reversed.

Ed. 974, if the estate of the Rathbone Manufacturing Company were being administered under the Bankruptcy Act, the claims of the Director General would not be entitled to preference. It is also plain, under Bramwell v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 269 U. S. 483, 46 S. Ct. 176, 70 L. Ed. 368, Price, Receiver, v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 46 S. Ct. 180, 70 L.

Butterworth-Judson Corporation, supra (January 11, 1926), that, in proceedings like the present one, debts due directly to the United States, nothing else appearing, are ordinarily entitled to priority under R.

In the circumstances presented by this record, it is reasonable to say that the statute confined his substantive rights to those which a carrier would have had, and prohibits him, as though he were an actual defendant in a suit, from resisting the demands of others for equal distribution of the insolvent's assets, under the commonly applied rule, upon the ground that he is an instrumentality of the federal government. To permit the claimed preference, we think, would conflict with the spirit and broad purpose of the statute.
