E. Whiting, of Columbia, S. C., for Early.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Messrs. A. C. Hinds, of Kingstree, S. C., and Henry E. Davis, of Florence, S. C., for Richardson.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below has certified to this court the following question of law upon which instruction is desired:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Is one, who purchases shares of stock of a national bank,      liable for an assessment subsequently imposed by the      Comptroller of the Currency upon the stock for the benefit of      the creditors of the bank after the insolvency thereof, when      it appears that the purchaser bought the stock from the      registered holder thereof and received a certificate therefor      endorsed in blank by the holder, with intent at the time of such purchase and delivery of giving      the stock to his minor child, but without knowledge at that      time of the failing condition of the bank, or intent to avoid      the stockholder's liability, and when, after the acceptance      of the endorsed certificate from the seller, and before the      insolvency, the purchaser with like knowledge and intent,      promptly presents the certificate to the bank, causes the      shares to be registered and a new certificate to be issued in      the child's name?'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was brought to recover the amount of an assessment upon 19 shares of the capital stock of the bank ordered by the Comptroller of the Currency because the assets of the bank were insufficient to pay creditors. Richardson had purchased the stock and received three certificates therefor indorsed in blank by the seller. He delivered these certificates to the bank with verbal instructions to register the stock and issue two new certificates for 16 shares in the name of his minor son, and another one for 3 shares in the name of his minor daughter. This was done, the new certificates being retained in the custody of the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Richardson bought the stock and received the certificates therefor, indorsed by the seller, title passed, and the transfer was complete as between the parties. Johnston v. Laflin, 103 U. S. 800, 804, 26 L. Ed. 532. Thereupon, as between seller and purchaser, the purchaser alone became liable for any assessment thereafter imposed; for, as between them, it would be in disregard of all equitable principles to continue against the seller the burdens of ownership after the purchaser had become entitled to all the benefits, including the receipt of dividends. Whether under the facts the liability of the seller continued, as between him and the creditors, is a different matter not necessary to be considered; for, in any event, the purchaser, who alone is sued, is not concerned with that question. That the actual owner of the stock may be held for the assessment, although his name does not appear upon the transfer books of the bank, is well settled. Ohio Valley National Bank v. Hulitt, 204 U. S. 162, 167, 168, 27 S. Ct. 179, 51 L. Ed. 423; Davis v. Stevens, 17 Blatchf. 259, 7 Fed. Cas. 177, 178 (No. 3,653); Case v. Small (C. C.) 10 F. 722, 724; Houghton v. Hubbell (C. C. A.) 91 F. 453.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real question is whether the intent of Richardson to buy the stock for his minor children, and the fact that by his direction the transfer was made to them upon the books of the bank and certificates issued in their names, had the effect of relieving Richardson from liability. We think not, since the traneferees, being minors, were without legal capacity to assume the obligation. Upon coming of age they would have an election either to affirm or avoid the entire transaction. In the meantime, the transfer of the stock having resulted to their disadvantage, the law will avoid it for them, thus leaving the liability of Richardson for assessments unaffected. See Aldrich v. Bingham (D. C.) 131 F. 363; Foster v. Chase (C. C.) 75 F. 797; Foster v. Wilson, Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Foster v.

As they could not themselves so assent as to be      bound to the liabilities of a shareholder, they could not so      authorize him to assent for them as to bind them.
