He died on December 8, 1921. As his death occurred within two years after the transfer, it fell within the terms of the statute creating a presumption that the transfer was made in contemplation of death. Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, &#167; 402(c), 42 Stat. 227, 277, 278. The remaining estate of the decedent, of which disposition was made by will (executed on the same day as the transfer in trust) was worth about $13,000. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue included the property transferred as part of decedent's gross estate, and demanded payment of an estate tax upon that basis. The payment was made, claim for refund was rejected, and this suit was brought by t e executors of the decedent against the collector to recover the amount paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury was waived.

The court said that the most that could be claimed for that evidence was that it established, and the court specifically found, that the transfer was not made 'under any consciousness or belief or apprehension that death was imminent.' The substance of the court's conclusion on all the evidence was that 'the plaintiffs have failed to show that the motive that induced this transfer, whatever it was, was not of the sort which leads to testamentary disposition, and, consequently, have failed to meet the burden of proof placed upon them by the statute.' The court then found a general verdict in favor of the defendant and directed judgment accordingly. (D.C.) 7 F.Supp. 742, 744.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the evidence, decided that the transfer was not made in contemplation of death, and reversed the judgment. 79 F.(2d) 602.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principles governing the determination whether a gift inter vivos is made 'in contemplation of death' are set forth in United States v.
