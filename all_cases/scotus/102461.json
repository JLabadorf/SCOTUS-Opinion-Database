W. Peters Corporation), appointed a receiver 'of the estate, property, moneys, debts and effects of every kind and nature' belonging to petitioner. Later, on February 25, 1935, after the writ of certiorari had been granted, the state court authorized the receiver 'to sell at public sale all right, title and interest that the receiver may have' in the present suit, which was described as 'pending in the United States Supreme Court entitled 'Peters Patent Corporation v. Bates &amp; Klinke, Inc.,' being No. 601 of the October Term, 1934.' The sale was made accordingly and was confirmed by the state court on February 27, 1935. From the petition to confirm the sale it appears that the receiver stipulated that 'he was not selling any right or title in and to any patents belonging to the plaintiff corporation.' Harriet E. Cole, the purchaser at the receiver's sale, has asked leave to intervene in this Court, but as she has not acquired through her purchase the title to, or an interest in, the patent, she is not entitled to seek an injunction to restrain infringement.
