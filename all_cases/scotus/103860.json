The case at bar is within neither those categories not that recognized by Ex parte Kawato, 317 U.S. 69, 63 S.Ct. 115, 87 L.Ed. &#8212;-, and Ex parte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 63 S.Ct. 793, 87 L.Ed. &#8212;-, viz., the use of auxiliary writs in exceptional cases in aid of this Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Government seeks to remove this case from the restrictions of the Act of 1925 on the ground that it was not intended to affect such special instances of direct review as that afforded by the Act of April 27, 1912.

Considerations no less controlling exist for treating it as a 'district court' within the scope of &#167; 238. The dominating policy of the Act of 1925 was to restrict direct review to this Court as a matter of right, and more particularly to shut off such direct review of the judgments of federal nisi prius courts. It would be wholly inconsistent with that Act to exclude the District Court for the District of Columbia from the scope of its provisions merely because that court did not become a district court in name until the Act of June 25, 1936, c. 804, 49 Stat. 1921.
