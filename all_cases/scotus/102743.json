He paid a tax of 50 per cent. of this profit in obedience to the taxing provision of the Silver Purchase Act of June 19, 1934,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> duly but unsuccessfully sought to have the amount of the tax refunded, and then brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the same.

The section further provides that the tax, besides reaching transfers thereafter made, shall be applicable to transfers made on or after May act, with the qualification that as to such act, with the qualification that as to such prior transfers the tax shall be paid in such manner and at such time as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may by regulation prescribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question presented for decision is whether, in view of the restraints of the due process of law clause of the Constitution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the retroactive provision under which the tax was exacted from the respondent is an admissible exertion of the power to tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Examination of the taxing provision and of pertinent decisions shows, as we think, that the answer must be in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The taxing provision does not impose a tax in respect of all transfers, but only in respect of such as yield a profit over cost and allowed expenses. If there be no profit, there is to be no tax. If there be a profit, the tax is to be 50 per cent. of it. Thus a profit is made the occasion for the tax and also the measure of it.
