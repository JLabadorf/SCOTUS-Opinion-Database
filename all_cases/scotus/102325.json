The Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057) became a law on February 24, 1919, with retroactive provisions as of January 1, 1918. Thereafter the petitioner filed an additional return in accordance with Treasury Decision 2797 (approved March 11, 1919, and quoted in our opinion in Nos. 37 to 39), showing an additional tax of $50,638.75. The Act of 1918 provides (section 250(d) that except in the case of fraud, 'the amount of tax due under any return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was made.' See, also, section 250(d), Revenue Act of 1921. A deficiency assessment was imposed in May, 1921, which is admitted to have been timely, and another on May 26, 1926, which is contested as too late. There is also a contest in respect of both deficiencies growing out of delay in the collection. True, written waivers were in existence, adequate in form, which extended the date for assessment and collection until December 31, 1926.

On the authority of decisions in the Ninth Circuit (Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering (National Paper Products Co. v.
