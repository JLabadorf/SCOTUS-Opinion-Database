Under order of the court the government filed a bill of particulars. 4 F.Supp. 662. Defendants then moved to quash the indictment. The motion was based upon the indictment, the bill of particulars, and an affidavit of defendants' counsel. The affidavit was an argumentative review of the bill of particulars for the purpose of showing that in view of its statements the government would be 'unable to make a case.' The court granted the motion to quash, and the government brought this appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 682, 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 682.

The motion and the affidavit in its support challenged the sufficiency of the indictment in the light of the bill of particulars. As it does not appear that the decision of the District Judge was based upon the construction or invalidity of the statute upon which the indictment is founded, and as it may well be that the decision was based upo  the construction of the indictment and its insufficiency as a pleading, this court is without jurisdiction of the appeal.
