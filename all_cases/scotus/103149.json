Gallagher, 306 U.S. 167, 59 S.Ct. 389, 83 L.Ed. &#8212;-, decided today. The appellant sought to restrain the State Board of Equalization of the State of California, its members, and the Attorney General of the state from enforcing the Use Tax of 1935, St.Cal.1935, p. 1297. A three-judge court granted an interlocutory injunction. Later, it denied a permanent injunction and dismissed the appellant's bill<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for the reasons stated in Southern Pacific Company v.

The same plant, facilities and organization are devoted to both interstate and intrastate business. In the necessary operation, maintenance and repair of its system, the appellant purchases outside California large amounts of equipment, apparatus, materials and supplies which are shipped to it in interstate commerce at various points within the state. The tangible personal property which the appellees threaten to tax is of two general classes: specific order and stand-by equipment. The first consists of central office switchboards, frames, cable racks, large private branch exchange switchboards, large underground cables, switches, central office cable, wire, protectors and other component parts of telephone and telegraph lines, which are purchased on specific order for installation at a particular place in the system. The second comprises goods bought from time to time for holding as stand-by supplies to meet fluctuating demands and emergencies and to make repairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific order equipment is shipped to the appellant at the place of use.

In most instances the trucks are driven directly to the building where the equipment is to be installed; in some, to distributing conters for reloading into other trucks which are driven to the place of installation. Occasionally, private branch exchange switchboards must be held by the appellant until the place of installation is ready. There is no holding in warehouses. The stand-by supplies which constitute a reserve to meet current requirements are replenished by monthly orders.
