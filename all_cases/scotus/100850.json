The claimant had private contracts to execute in which it could use this way, and which were thus delayed. The negotiation as to this way took place before the contract was drafted and executed. The contract provided for a compensation board to fix the cost, and specified elements of cost to be considered, including a proper proportion for loss resulting from displacement of, or delay, in work contracted for prior to the date of the contract caused by or attributed to work under emergency conditions by the contractor for the government, and items similar thereto in principle. The Court of Claims held that all the items of the claim were covered by the decision and award of the board, except one for $1,500, for which it gave judgment.

The suit was for breach of this restriction. The finding of the Court of Claims showed that no tuberculosis cases as such were received, and that the only ones actually housed were brought in for the purpose of an operation or the like. It was also alleged by the claimant that syphilitic cases were treated in the hospital. The finding of the court was that such cases were not contagious within the meaning of the contract and denied the claim for damages.

The Ordinance Department notified the contractor to suspend operations under the contract December 14, 1918. The general manager of the claimant discussed the question of termination with the local claims board at St. Louis, which declined to recommend payment for anything unless the suspension was accepted. Thereupon a complete settlement was made, and the amount agreed upon paid. There was a reservation in the settlement, which by no reasonable construction could include the claim here made.
