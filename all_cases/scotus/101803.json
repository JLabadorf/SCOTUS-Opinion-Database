In 1916 its officers caused Hamilton &amp; De Loss, Inc., to be organized, to erect a factory and to take over the work of its stamping department. During the taxable periods six men owned 93.71 per cent. of the stock of petitioner. The same men owned over 75 per cent. of the stock of Hamilton &amp; De Loss, Inc. Hamilton did not own or control any of the stock of petitioner. Twenty per cent. of the stock of the new company was issued to him and he became its president. He gave to a bank his notes indorsed by De Loss to obtain money to pay for the stock. Before the beginning of 1918 he executed an irrevocable stock power to one Higgins, and the latter, by like instrument, assigned the stock to De Loss who deposited it with the bank as collateral security for the payment of Hamilton's notes. Hamilton failed to pay, and February 1, 1919, after the expiration of the tax periods, De Loss paid the notes and took over the stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to that time Hamilton attended all the stockholders' meetings but never voted in opposition to the owners of the majority stock of both corporations. Hamilton &amp; De Loss, Inc., paid him a salary at the rate of $10,000 per year, but the other officers of that corporation, being officers, directors, or employees of the petitioner, received their compensation from the latter although a large part of their time was devoted to the business of the former.

But it does not appear that as between him and Hamilton he was entitled to control voting power or to have the stock transferred to him of record or to have any use or benefit therefrom unless and until required to pay the notes. It was not held by or for him. The losses sustained by Hamilton &amp; De Loss, Inc., did not, in respect of that stock, directly or indirectly result to his disadvantage.
