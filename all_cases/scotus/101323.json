A corporation is not a mere collection of individuals capable of claiming all benefits assured them by section 2, article 4, of the Constitution. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 584, 586, 587, 10 L. Ed. 274; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. Ed. 357; Western Turf Association v. Greenberg, 204 U. S. 359, 363, 27 S. Ct. 384, 51 L. Ed. 520. See, also, Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 77, 21 L. Ed. 394. In the first of the causes just cited, Chief Justice Taney, for the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It is true that in the case referred to (United States Bank      v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 3 L. Ed. 38) this court decided that      in a question of jurisdiction they might look to the character of the persons composing a corporation; and if it      appeared that they were citizens of another state, and the      fact was set forth by proper averments, the corporation might      sue in its corporate name in the courts of the United States.      * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'But the principle has never been extended any farther than      it was carried in that case, and has never been supposed to      extend to contracts made by a corporation, especially in      another sovereignty. If it were held to embrace contracts,      and that the members of a corporation were to be regarded as      individuals, carrying on business in their corporate name,      and therefore entitled to the privileges of citizens, in      matters of contract, it is very clear that they must, at the      same time, take upon themselves the liabilities of citizens,      and be bound by their contracts in like manner. The result of      this would be to make a corporation a mere partnership in      business, in which each stockholder would be liable, to the      whole extent of his property, for the debts of the      corporation; and he might be sued for them, in any state in      which he might happen to be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The clause of the Constitution referred to certainly never      intended to give to the citizens of each state the privileges      of citizens in the several states, and at the same time to      exempt them from the liabilities which the exercise of such      privileges would bring upon individuals who were citizens of      the state. This would be to give the citizens of other states      far higher and greater privileges than are enjoyed by the      citizens of the state itself. Besides, it would deprive every      state of all control over the extent of corporate franchises      proper to be granted in the state; and corporations would be      chartered in one, to carry on their operations in another. It      is impossible, upon any sound principle, to give such a      construction to the article in question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Whenever a corporation makes a contract, it is the contract      of the legal entity-of the artificial being created by the charter-and not the contract of the individual      members. The only rights it can claim are the rights which      are given to it in that character, and not the rights which      belong to its members as citizens of a state; and we now      proceed to inquire what rights the plaintiffs in error, a      corporation created by Georgia, could lawfully exercise in      another state, and whether the purchase of the bill of      exchange on which this suit is brought was a valid contract,      and obligatory on the parties.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously the trust here involved, is a creature of local law which demands the privilege of carrying on business in Michigan as an association-an entity-clothed with peculiar rights and privileges under a deed of settlement undertaking to exempt all of the associates from personal liability. As in the case of a corporation and for the same general reasons it cannot rely upon rights guaranteed to the individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a given association is called a corporation, partnership, or trust, is not the essential factor in determining the powers of a state concerning it. The real nature of the organization must be considered. If clothed with the ordinary functions and attributes of a corporation, it is subject to similar treatment. This was distinctly pointed out in Oliver v. The Liverpool &amp; London Life &amp; Fire Ins. Co., 100 Mass. 531, affirmed here sub nom. Liverpool Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 566, 19 L. Ed. 1029. See, also, Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 162, 31 S. Ct. 342, 55 L. Ed. 389, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Hecht v. Malley, 265 U. S. 144, 44 S. Ct. 462, 68 L.

A corporation is not a mere collection of individuals capable of claiming all benefits assured them by Section 2, Article IV, of the Constitution. <i>Bank of Augusta</i> v. <i>Earle,</i> 13 Peters 519, 584, 586, 587; <i>Paul</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 8 Wall. 168; <i>Western Turf Association</i> v. <i>Greenberg,</i> 204 U.S. 359, 363.

If it were held to embrace contracts, and that the members of a corporation were to be regarded as individuals carrying on business in their corporate name, and therefore entitled to the privileges of citizens, in matters of contract, it is very clear that they must at the same time take upon themselves the liabilities of citizens, and be bound by their contracts in like manner. The result of this would be to make a corporation a mere partnership in business, in which each stockholder would be liable to the whole extent of his property for the debts of the corporation; and he might be sued for them, in any state in which he might happen to be found.</p>\n<p>\"The clause of the Constitution referred to certainly never intended to give to the citizens of each state the privileges of citizens in the several states, and at the same time to exempt them from the liabilities which the exercise of such privileges would bring upon individuals who were citizens of the state. This would be to give the citizens of other states far higher and greater privileges than are enjoyed by the citizens of the state itself. Besides, it would deprive every state of all control over the extent of corporate franchises proper to be granted in the state; and corporations would be chartered in one, to carry on their operations in another. It is impossible upon any sound principle to give such a construction to the article in question.</p>\n<p>\"Whenever a corporation makes a contract, it is the contract of the legal entity; of the artificial being created <span class=\"star-pagination\">*550</span> by the charter; and not the contract of the individual members. The only rights it can claim are the rights which are given to it in that character, and not the rights which belong to its members as citizens of a state; and we now proceed to inquire what rights the plaintiffs in error, a corporation created by Georgia, could lawfully exercise in another state; and whether the purchase of the bill of exchange on which this suit is brought was a valid contract, and obligatory on the parties.\"</p>\n<p>Obviously the Trust here involved, is a creature of local law which demands the privilege of carrying on business in Michigan as an association  an entity  clothed with peculiar rights and privileges under a deed of settlement undertaking to exempt all of the associates from personal liability.

She defended upon the ground, among others, that the payee was a foreign corporation within the meaning of the Michigan statutes; that it had not complied therewith; and, consequently, could not maintain the action. Both <span class=\"star-pagination\">*544</span> the trial and Supreme Court of the State sustained this defense.</p>\n<p>Relevant provisions of the statutes follow  Mich. Compiled Laws, 1915:</p>\n<p>\"Sec. 9063. It shall be unlawful for any corporation organized under the laws of any state of the United States, except the state of Michigan, or of any foreign country, to carry on its business in this state, until it shall have procured from the secretary of state of this state a certificate of authority for that purpose. . . .\"</p>\n<p>\"Sec. 9068.
