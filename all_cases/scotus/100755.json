Before 1913 petitioners or their predecessors severally contracted with it for water to be used during long terms, on definitely described parcels of land, at prices based upon their total areas, at specified rates per acre, whether actually consumed or not. Payment of the stipulated sums was secured by liens on the entire tracts; rights so acquired were appurtenant to the land, and constituted a servitude upon the water. Other stipulations concerned lateral ditches, etc. Those who held these agreements are referred to as contract customers. Other parties-noncontract customers-were supplied and charged according to number of acres actually irrigated from year to year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1918 the Railroad Commission permitted a general increase of rates, but gave contract customers somewhat lower ones than those prescribed for others.

But, manifestly, the matters <span class=\"star-pagination\">*359</span> referred to form no part of the record and are not adequate to create a federal question when no such question was necessarily decided below, and the record does not disclose that such issues were set up or claimed in any proper manner in the courts of the State.\"</p>\n<p>As we interpret its opinion and judgment the court below ruled only that the order of the Commission fixed rates to be charged, leaving all other questions subject to determination by the courts. Counsel for the Commission affirmed this interpretation and at the bar agreed that judgment here might rest thereon. In printed argument he said: \"Except as to rates, the Commission did not attempt (in fact, expressly disclaimed any attempt) to change any of the provisions of these contracts, and the effect of this rate order, as a matter of law, on those other provisions was left by the Commission for determination by the courts as the occasion might arise.\" The decision below upon this point of local law is enough to support the judgment and leaves no federal question open for our determination.</p>\n<p>In cases where the state court has decided a local question adequate to support its judgment this court has sometimes affirmed, and sometimes has dismissed the writ of error. <i>Murdock</i> v. <i>Memphis,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></span>, 634-636; <i>Eustis</i> v. <i>Bolles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93710\"><a href=\"/opinion/93710/eustis-v-bolles/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 370; <i>Southern Pacific Co.</i> v. <i>Schuyler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97816\"><a href=\"/opinion/97816/southern-pacific-co-v-schuyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 610; <i>Howat</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99939\"><a href=\"/opinion/99939/howat-v-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>; <i>Browne</i> v. <i>Union Pacific,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100580\"><a href=\"/opinion/100580/browne-v-union-pacific-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>. We have again considered the matter and have concluded that, generally at least, it is better practice to dismiss.</p>\n<p>The writ of error must be</p>\n<p><i>Dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>",
