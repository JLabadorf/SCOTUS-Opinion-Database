October 10, 1917, the Secretary of the Navy issued a general order giving the corresponding grades in which both ship's writers and yeomen in the Coast Guard were tabulated as corresponding to yeoman, first-class, in the Navy, instead of chief yeoman in the Navy. The tabulated statement by the Commandant of the Coast Guard was in many other respects changed by the Navy Department. The action of the Navy Department was carried out by a circular letter from the Coast Guard headquarters, and, according to it, pay of all petty officers and nearly all enlisted men in the Coast Guard was higher than the pay in the Navy, thus giving to such officers no benefit of section 15 of the Act of May 22, 1917.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Allen, during the time covered by his claim, was paid as a yeoman in the Coast Guard, $1,783.80; as chief yeoman in the Navy, he would have received $2,270.12, a difference of $486.32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The finding of the court was that he was entitled to recover the sum of $486.32 more than that which he did receive, and it awarded him judgment for that amount, rejecting the contention of the government that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The fact that Congress did not expressly provide what grades      and ratings of the Coast Guard should be considered      'corresponding' to the grades and ratings in the Navy left      that fact to be determined by the Secretary of the Navy.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The finding and judgment of the court are in accordance with a table of grades and ratings submitted by the Commandant of the Coast Guard, pursuant to section 15 of the Act of May 22, 1917, above referred to. To this table of ratings, and the action of the Commandant, the United States opposes the order of the Secretary of the Navy, No. 329, and maintains that it was the duty of the latter, under the Act of May 22, 1917, in order to standardize the pay of the Coast Guard and Navy, to determine what were the corresponding grades or ratings.

It held that the test of correspondence or equality was the duties and responsibilities of yeomen in the Coast Guard and yeomen in the Navy. In other words, it was the judgment of the court, that as the duties and qualifications of the officers were of duties is a question of fact, not a matter of deference to the judgment of of duties is a question of fact, the Secretary of the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The court said:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The statute [Act of May 22, 1917] was passed by Congress for      the purpose of equalizing as far as possible the pay of      officers of the Coast Guard with that of officers of the      Navy.

In the case at bar a Coast Guard officer renders      similar service to that rendered by a naval officer, has the      same duties to perform, and possesses the same      qualifications; the pay of the Coast Guard officer can be      assimilated to the pay of the officer of the Navy, and      therefore we think that the plaintiff is entitled to receive      the pay prescribed for chief yeoman in the Navy.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion was that the purpose of the act was 'to establish uniformity in the pay of like officers in the Coast Guard and Navy,' and that it could not be defeated by an administrative order of the Secretary of the Navy.
