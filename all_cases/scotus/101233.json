Any excess so      received over the cost of his stock to the stockholder, or      over its fair market value as of March 1, 1913, if acquired      prior thereto, is a taxable profit. A distribution in      liquidation of the assets and business of a corporation,      which is a return to the stockholder of the value of his      stock upon a surrender of his interest in the corporation, is      distinguishable from a dividend paid by a going corporation      out of current earnings or accumulated surplus when declared      by the directors in their discretion, which is in the nature      of a recurrent return upon the stock.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These Regulations, with a change made in 1921 as to the second sentence of article 1548,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> are still in effect so far as distributions in liquidation under the act are concerned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the Hellmans owned one-half of the capital stock of a corporation which had a net surplus of $46,466.27, of which at least $31,545.58 consisted of earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913. In 1919, the corporation was dissolved and liquidated and its assets were distributed to the stockholders. In this liquidation each of the Hellmans realized a gain of $15,004.55 in the distribution made out of the earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913. Each in his income tax return claimed that this was a 'dividend' which under section 216(a) being Comp. St. &#167; 6336 1/8 h was to be credited on his net income for the purpose of the normal tax. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, ruling these were gains subject to the normal tax, disallowed the claims and made the additional assessments here involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case is in direct conflict with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Langstaff v.

See Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S. 339, 344-346, 38 S. Ct. 543, 62 L. Ed. 1149, and Langstaff v. Lucas (D.

Murphy, 96 U. S. 153, 159, 24 L. Ed. 844, we think it clear that the general definition of a dividend in section 201(a) was not intended to apply to distributions made to stockholders in the liquidation of a corporation, but that it was intended that such distributions should be governed by section 201(c), which, dealing specifically with such liquidation provided that the amounts distributed should 'be treated as payments in exchange for stock' and that any gain realized thereby should be taxed to the stockholders 'as other gains or profits.' This brings the two sections into entire harmony, and gives to each its natural meaning and due effect. The Treasury Regulations correctly interpreted the act as making section 201(a) applicable to a distribution made by a going corporation to its stockholders in the ordinary course of business, and section 201(c) applicable to a distribution made to stockholders in liquidation of the corporation. And this is in accord with the rulings of the Board of Tax Appeals. Appeal of Greenwood, 1 B. T. A. 291, 295; Appeal of Chandler, 3 B. T.

The objection that this results in double taxation of the accumulated earnings and profits is no more available in the one case than it would have been in the other. See Merchants' L. &amp; T. Co. v.

When, as here, Congress has clearly expressed its intention, the statute must be sustained even though double taxation results. See Patton v. Brady, 184 U. S. 608, 22 S. Ct. 493, 46 L. Ed. 713; Cream of Wheat Co. v. Grand Forks, 253 U. S. 325, 330, 40 S. Ct. 558, 64 L.

(2d) 1022.</p>\n<p>The controlling question is whether the amounts distributed to the stockholders out of the earnings and profits accumulated by the corporation since February 28, 1913, were to be treated under § 201(a) as \"dividends,\" which were exempt from the normal tax; or, under § 201(c) as payments made by the corporation in exchange for its stock, which were taxable \"as other gains or profits.\"</p>\n<p>It is true that if § 201 (a) stood alone its broad definition of the term \"dividend\" would apparently include distributions made to stockholders in the liquidation of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*237</span> corporation  although this term, as generally understood and used, refers to the recurrent return upon stock paid to stockholders by a going corporation in the ordinary course of business, which does not reduce their stock holdings and leaves them in a position to enjoy future returns upon the same stock. See <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>Hornby,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></span>, 344-346; and <i>Langstaff</i> v. <i>Lucas</i> (D.C.) 9 F. (2d) 691, 694.</p>\n<p>However, when § 201(a) and § 201(c) are read together, under the long-established rule that the intention of the lawmaker is to be deduced from a view of every material part of the statute, <i>Kohlsaat</i> v. <i>Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89689\"><a href=\"/opinion/89689/kohlsaat-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 159, we think it clear that the general definition of a dividend in § 201(a) was not intended to apply to distributions made to stockholders in the liquidation of a corporation, but that it was intended that such distributions should be governed by § 201(c), which, dealing specifically with such liquidation, provided that the amounts distributed should \"be treated as payments in exchange for stock\" and that any gain realized thereby should be taxed to the stockholders \"as other gains or profits.\" This brings the two sections into entire harmony, and gives to each its natural meaning and due effect. The Treasury Regulations correctly interpreted the Act as making § 201(a) applicable to a distribution made by a going corporation to its stockholders in the ordinary course of business, and § 201 (c) applicable to a distribution made to stockholders in liquidation of the corporation. And this is in accord with the rulings of the Board of Tax Appeals. <i>Appeal of Greenwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4487275\"><a href=\"/opinion/4707851/appeal-of-greenwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.T.A.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 295; <i>Appeal of Chandler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4494770\"><a href=\"/opinion/4714982/appeals-of-chandler/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.T.A.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 149.</p>\n<p>The gains realized by the stockholders from the distribution of the assets in liquidation were subject to the normal tax in like manner as if they had sold their stock to third persons. The objection that this results in double taxation of the accumulated earnings and profits is no more <span class=\"star-pagination\">*238</span> available in the one case than it would have been in the other. See <i>Merchants' L. &amp; T. Co.</i> v. <i>Smietanki,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99765\"><a href=\"/opinion/99765/merchants-loan-trust-co-v-smietanka/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>; <i>Goodrich</i> v. <i>Edwards,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99767\"><a href=\"/opinion/99767/goodrich-v-edwards/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>. When, as here, Congress has clearly expressed its intention, the statute must be sustained even though double taxation results. See <i>Patton</i> v. <i>Brady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95617\"><a href=\"/opinion/95617/patton-v-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span>; <i>Cream of Wheat Co.</i> v. <i>Grand Forks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99617\"><a href=\"/opinion/99617/cream-of-wheat-co-v-county-of-grand-forks/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 330.</p>\n<p>The decree is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]   40 Stat. 1057, 1058, c. 18.</p>\n<p>[2]   Regulations 45, 1919 ed., 237, 240.</p>\n<p>[3]   By Treas.
