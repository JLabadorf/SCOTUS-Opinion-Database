Discretionary authority in the Board to revoke a parole <i>at any time before expiration of a parolee's sentence</i> was provided  and is necessary  as a means of insuring the public that parole violators would be punished.<sup>[8]</sup> The proper working of the parole system requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*363</span> that the Board have authority to discipline, guide and control parole violators whose sentences have not been completed. It is not reasonable to assume that Congress intended that a parolee whose conduct measures up to parole standards should remain under control of the Board until expiration of the term of his sentence, but that misconduct of a parole violator could result in reducing the time during which the Board has control over him to a period less than his original sentence.</p>\n<p>Parole is intended to be a means of restoring offenders who are good social risks to society; to afford the unfortunate another opportunity by clemency  under guidance and control of the Board.<sup>[9]</sup> Unless a parole violator can be required to serve some time in prison in addition to that imposed for an offence committed while on parole, he not only escapes punishment for the unexpired portion of his original sentence, but the disciplinary power of the Board will be practically nullified. If the parole laws should be construed as respondent contends, parole might be more reluctantly granted, contrary to the broad humane purpose of Congress to grant relief from imprisonment to deserving prisoners.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondents have not completed service of their original sentences and were not entitled to release. The causes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*364</span> are reversed and remanded to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
