The preference sought by the state was denied. The claim is founded upon alleged overcharges in railway passenger fares, exacted of the state of Missouri by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company during the years 1907 to 1913, inclusive, contrary to the provisions of the Missouri statute of 1907 (Laws Mo. 1907, p. 170). In a suit to enjoin the enforcement of that statute, an interlocutory injunction was granted by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri, and later a final decree made the injunction permanent. St. Louis &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. Hadley, 168 F. 317. In 1913, on a direct appeal to this Court under authority of section 5 of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891 (c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 827, 828, Jud. Code, 1911, &#167; 238), the constitutional validity of the Missouri statute was sustained and the parties to the suit which embraced the Missouri Pacific Railway Company were directed to apply to the court below for the entry of an appropriate decree. Missouri Rate Cases, 230 U.S. 474, 33 S.Ct. 975, 57 L.Ed. 1571; Knott v. Missouri Pacific Railway Co., 230 U.S. 509, 511, 33 S.Ct. 984, 57 L.Ed. 1595. Thereafter, the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri entered a decree dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill, and appointing a master to hear claims for ad interim overcharges.

By the Act of February 13, 1925 (c. 229, &#167; 1, 43 Stat. 938 (28 USCA &#167; 345)), the provision for a direct appeal to this Court from the decree of a District Court in cases involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, was deleted. While provision was retained for a direct review in this Court in cases involving an application for interlocutory injunction to prevent state officers from enforcing a state statute in violation of the Federal Constitution, this provision obtained only where the hearing in the District Court was before three judges, as provided by section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA &#167; 380).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is dismissed for the want of jurisdiction.
