That State demanded that it pay, for 1933, the tax laid by the Act of 1921 as amended (No. 85, &#167;&#167; 4, 5, Public Acts 1921, as amended by No. 175, Public Acts 1929) which requires that 'every corporation organized or doing business under the laws of this state * * * shall * * * for the privilege of exercising its franchise and of transacting its business within this state, pay * * * an annual fee * * * upon each dollar of its paid-up capital and surplus * * *'; but no property or capital located without the state 'and none of the capital or surplus of such corporation represented by property exclusively used in interstate commerce, shall in any case enter into the computation. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of the State sustained the tax.

Corporation Tax Appeal Board, 287 U.S. 295, 53 S.Ct. 137, 138, 77 L.Ed. 314, we considered appellant's claim to exemption from the demand for 1930, under the same statute. It there appeared that in addition to general power to own and operate the bridge, and do whatever is related to that enterprise, the corporation had authority to carry on other business in Michigan and elsewhere. 'It has failed to establish that it has no power to carry on any business that is not within the protection of the commerce clause.' Consequently we did not consider whether it was engaging in foreign commerce, but affirmed the judgment below upholding the tax.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to our decision, and prior to the tax year 1933, the corporate charter was amended.

It 'conveys no persons or goods across the international boundary line. It merely collects tolls from such persons as use it (the bridge). It provides an instrumentality which others may use in conducting foreign commerce.' Unless, by reason of what appellant is now shown to do, it engages in foreign commerce, then, considering our ruling upon the appeal challenging the tax for 1930 (287 U.S. 295, 53 S.Ct. 137, 77 L.Ed. 314), clearly, the judgment below must be affirmed.
