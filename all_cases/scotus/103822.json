In 1942 he made a motion in that court to set aside the judgment of conviction on the grounds, among others, that the indictment did not state an offense against the United States and that he had been denied the assistance of counsel at the trial. The District Court denied the motion without taking testimony or making findings of fact, and denied an application for rehearing. Petitioner lodged with the clerk of the District Court a petition for leave to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals in forma pauperis. The clerk returned this to him by letter, stating, 'Under the law the petition to prosecute an appeal in forma pauperis should be submitted to the United States circuit court of appeals and not the district court. Therefore your motion for leave to appeal in forma pauperis and order thereon are returned herewith.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner then applied to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, which court denied the application. He now seeks certiorari in this Court under &#167; 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 377, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 377 (see In re 620 Church St. Corporation, 299 U.S. 24, 26, 57 S.Ct. 88, 89, 81 L.Ed. 16; Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U.S. 342, 348, 550, 61 S.Ct. 1015, 1016, 85 L.Ed. 1392, n. 2), upon a petition which sets up, among other alleged errors, the denial by the District Court of his motion to set aside the judgment of conviction, and its refusal to entertain his application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.

Appeal from the District Court's order denying petitioner's motion to vacate the conviction is governed by &#167; 8(c) of the Act of February 13, 1925, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 230, 28 U.S.C.A. &#167; 230, which requires that proper application be made for allowance of an appeal. Wells v. United States, 318 U.S. 257, 63 S.Ct. 582, 87 L.Ed. &#8212;-, and cases cited. But petitioner's filing of a motion for leave to appeal with the clerk of the District Court was a sufficient application, in view of the fact that an appeal may be allowed by either the District Court or the district judge.

It is plain that under these provisions petitioner, being a poor person entitled to prosecute an appeal from the trial court to the Circuit Court of Appeals, was authorized to apply to the District Court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis and that it was the duty of the District Court to entertain his application. See Wells v. United States, supra. The statute authorizes the suit, including the appeal, to be prosecuted in forma pauperis upon order of the court in which the proceeding is commenced. The right to appeal in forma pauperis from the District Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals is not conditioned upon the consent of the Circuit Court of Appeals, even though it be assumed that that court could grant such permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows that petitioner's application for appeal in forma pauperis should have been entertained by the District Court and that opportunity should now be given to that court to act on the application before the consideration of other questions which the petitioner seeks to raise here by his application for certiorari.
