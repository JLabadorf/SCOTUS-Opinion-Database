Immediately after assuming the duties of the office, as required by the local statutes, he procured license and executed bond with the Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company of Maryland as surety.

Petitioner endeavored to find another acceptable surety. Failing in this, he reported the circumstances to the court; pointed out his inability to comply with the local statutes; and stated that, unless the business could continue substantially as theretofore, the purpose of the receivership would be frustrated. He asked authority to proceed without bond or license; otherwise, he affirmed, final liquidation at material loss to all concerned would be necessary. The Attorney General, speaking for the state, objected. The court ordered and directed petitioner 'to continue his operations as such Receiver (including the production, distribution and sale of gasoline or motor vehicle fuel in the State of California) after termination of the hereinbefore mentioned bond, or withdrawal therefrom of the surety thereon, for the payment of gasoline taxes * * * without any such bond or the giving of security in any other manner for the payment of such gasoline taxes and without any license. * * *' The Circuit Court of Appeals held section 65 of Judicial Code (28 USCA &#167; 124) applicable and controlling, and reversed the challenged order.

And finally because, in the circumstances here presented, it is impossible for the receiver to comply with the prescribed requirements; and, unless relieved from them, he 'must cease receivership operations that are essential to the conservation of assets and the general purposes of the receivership.' Manifestly the diminution, if any, of powers possessed by District Courts prior to its enactment, results from section 65, Judicial Code.

Whatever may be the inherent power of a court incident to a grant of jurisdiction  <i>Michaelson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100475\"><a href=\"/opinion/100475/michaelson-v-united-states-ex-rel-chicago-st-p-m-or-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 66  there seems no ground whatever for saying that Congress cannot withhold or withdraw from courts of equity the right to empower receivers in conservation proceedings to disregard local statutes.</p>\n<p>The suggestion that to require petitioner to observe local laws would give the State inequitable priority over the United States as to taxes lacks merit. If any such result should follow it would accompany permissive action of Congress.</p>\n<p>And if the receiver cannot continue to carry on the Company's business according to the plain direction of Congress, he must pursue some other course permitted by law.</p>\n<p>The same statute which required receivers to observe the laws of the State, gave permission to sue them in state courts under stated circumstances. It was enacted more than forty years ago and seems to have been commonly regarded as within congressional authority.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*67</span> We are not dealing here with the acknowledged power of courts to protect property in their custody. <i>In re Tyler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93608\"><a href=\"/opinion/93608/in-re-tyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, and similar cases are not pertinent.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
