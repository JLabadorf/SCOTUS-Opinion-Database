The shipments, including coal, sand, cement, piling, and lumber, were made in the years 1909 to 1916, inclusive.

The Court of Claims held that all the shipments belonged to the United States, and that it was entitled to transportation of its property at 50 per cent. of the tariff rates on the aided lines first above referred to, and to free transportation on those last mentioned, and found that it was not shown whether appellant was informed as to the title to the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further found that in every instance appellant made out and presented freight bills to the government for the net charges after making proper land grant deductions, and that the payment of the full amount so claimed was made and accepted without protest.
