The District Court affirmed his action; but the court below held the claim valid and allowable under section 63a(4) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 563 (USCA title 11, c. 7, &#167; 103(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trustee, petitioner here, maintains that the quoted provision of the lease imposed a penalty and did not express any lawful purpose to fix the liquidated damages which might follow failure to perform.
