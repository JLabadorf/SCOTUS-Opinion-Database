The question relates to the constitutional authority of the state of Oklahoma to tax certain property used by the respondent in its operations as lessee. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that the property was not taxable because the lessee was a federal instrumentality and Congress had not consented to its taxation. 177 Okl. 67, 57 P.(2d) 1167.

The tax is an ad valorem tax for the year 1933&#8212;34. There is no allegation or finding that the tax was discriminatory, the sole contention being that the property was not subject to ad valorem taxation because of its use as an adjunct to the production of oil and gas from the leasehold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decisions distinguish between a nondiscriminatory tax upon the property of an agent of government and one which imposes a direct burden upon the exertion of governmental powers. In the former case where there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of governmental functions, we have held that a nondis criminatory ad valorem tax is valid, although the property is used in the operations of the governmental agency. This distinction, recognized by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436, 4 L.Ed. 579, was stated and applied after full consideration in Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 9 Wall. 579, 591, 19 L.Ed. 792, and Union P. Railroad Company v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 31&#8212;36, 21 L.Ed. 787. Recent illustrations are found in Alward v.

Johnston, 293 U.S. 533, 55 S.Ct. 238, 79 L.Ed. 641, where a tax known as the 'gasoline road toll' was held to be payable by a rural mail carrier who delivered the mail by means of his own motor vehicle.
