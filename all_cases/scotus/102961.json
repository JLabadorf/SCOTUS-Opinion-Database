The Commission denied a rehearing with premission to apply for an increase of rates if, after a reasonable time, it should appear that a definite change in prices had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In certiorari proceedings, appellant challenged these determinations and orders as unlawful and confiscatory, in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The appellate Division, Third Department, of the Supreme Court of the State, sustained the action of the Commission, 245 App.Div. 866, 282 N.Y.S. 412, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Appellate Division, 275 N.Y. 357, 9 N.E.2d 961.

Appellant contends that it is entitled to the exercise of the independent judgment of a court as to the law and the facts with respect to the issue of confiscation, and that such a review has not been accorded because of the limitations imposed by the state practice in certiorari proceedings. 275 N.Y. 357, at page 370, 9 N.E.2d 961.
