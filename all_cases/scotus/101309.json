The court dismissed the suit on motion, for want of equity; and this was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, without consideration of the federal question, on the ground that under sections 9971 and 9973 of the Compiled Oklahoma Statutes 1921, the petitioner had a plain, adequate and exclusive remedy at law by paying the tax under protest and suing for its recovery.
