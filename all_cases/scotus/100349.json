And, if there was objection to appearing as a suitor in a foreign court, it was open to that government to make the asserted public status and immunity of the vessel the subject of diplomatic representations to the end that, if that claim was recognized by the Executive Department of this government, it might be set forth and supported in an appropriate suggestion to the court by the Attorney General, or some law officer acting under his direction.\"</p>\n<p>Treating <i>Ex parte Muir</i> as relevant, appellant insists that within the meaning of the declaration there made the master of the <i>Gul Djemal,</i> a duly commissioned officer of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> the Turkish Navy, was the accredited and recognized representative of that government, possessed of adequate authority to protest against the seizure and object to the court's jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>We agree with the view advanced by the appellee. <i>The Anne,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span>, reaffirmed by <i>The Sao Vicente,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100051\"><a href=\"/opinion/100051/the-sao-vicente/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, is enough to show that the immunity could not have been successfully set up by a duly recognized consul, representative of his sovereign in commercial matters, in the ordinary course of his official duties, and there seems no adequate reason to presume that the master of the <i>Gul Djemal</i> had any greater authority in respect thereto. Although an officer of the Turkish Navy, he was performing no naval or military duty, and was serving upon a vessel not functioning in naval or military capacity but engaged in commerce under charter to a private individual who undertook to carry passengers and goods for hire. He was not shown to have any authority to represent his sovereign other than can be inferred from his position as master and the circumstances specified in the stipulation of facts.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MR.
