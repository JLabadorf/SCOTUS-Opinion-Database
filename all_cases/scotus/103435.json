The suit is based on a contract between respondent and the United States rather than on Title VII of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1747, 7 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 623 note 644 et seq., which authorizes refunds to processors, under certain circumstances, of processing taxes illegally collected under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 48 Stat. 31, 7 U.S.C.A. &#167; 601 et seq.

On June 6, 1933, respondent submitted its bid, and on June 24, 1933, executed a contract with the United States whereby respondent agreed to furnish a specified number of the suits at a stated price. The contract provided, in the 'federal taxes' clause, that: 'Prices set forth herein include any Federal Tax heretofore imposed by the Congress which is applicable to the material purchased under this contract. If any sales tax, processing tax, adjustment charge, or other taxes or charges are imposed or changed by the Congress after the date set for the opening of the bid upon which this contract is based and made applicable directly upon the production, manufacture or sale of the supplies covered by this contract and are paid by the contractor on the articles or supplies herein contracted for, then the prices named in this contract will be increased or decreased accordingly. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To perform its contract with the United States, respondent contracted to purchase cotton cloth, thread, and labels from subcontractors who were liable, as processors, to pay any processing taxes levied on the articles sold to respondent. At the time these contracts were made no taxes were in effect on the processing of cotton, but in anticipation of such taxes respondent and the subcontractors agreed that respondent would reimburse them for any taxes they were required to pay on the processing of goods sold to respondent, the taxes to be billed as a separate item. Thereafter, respondent received the goods covered by these contracts and compensated the subcontractors for the taxes they were later required to pay on the processing of the cotton. It has performed its contract with the United States and now claims that the quoted provision obligates the United States to pay respondent the amounts it has paid its subcontractors to compensate them for the processing taxes they have paid. Because the Comptroller General rejected its claim, respondent brought this suit in the Court of Claims and obtained judgment. 32 F.Supp. 141. We granted certiorari on October 14, 1940, to resolve the uncertainty as to the correct construction of the 'federal taxes' clause which appears in a large number of government contracts. 311 U.S. 624, 61 S.Ct. 24, 85 L.Ed. &#8212;-.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only question is whether the United States, in the 'federal taxes' clause, has agreed to pay respondent the amount respondent paid its subcontractors to reimburse them for taxes paid on the processing of the goods sold to respondent.

The supplies 'covered by this contract' are the mechanics' suits, the completed articles furnished to the United States. Since the clause further provides in exact language that the tax must be 'directly' applicable, we cannot agree that a tax on the cloth, thread, and labels is a tax on the 'supplies covered by this contract'. Compare Telescope Folding Furniture Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 31 F.Supp. 780, 784; United States v. Glenn L.

It is reasonable to conclude that this phrase also contemplates payment of taxes to the United States in consequence of an obligation imposed by statute upon respondent. For while in a sense, perhaps, respondent 'paid' these processing taxes, it is more accurate to say that they were 'paid' by the subcontractors who merely shifted their burden to respondent as a separate item of the contract price.
