The court expressed the opinion that the defendants' regulations did not violate the Shipping Commissioners Act (§ 4501, <i>et seq.</i> Rev. Stats.), nor the Anti-Trust Law, and held besides that appellant \"is not shown to have any standing entitling him to seek in court the general relief for which he prays.\" And further said, \"He is not in a position to vindicate general governmental policies, nor is he `the agency to establish the public welfare.'\"</p>\n<p>A decree was entered dismissing the complaint, to review which this appeal was obtained, and is prosecuted.</p>\n<p>The assignment of errors attacks the decree with detail of particulars, affirming the sufficiency of the complaint and the grounds of relief which it expresses.</p>\n<p>This appeal is direct from the District Court and we encounter at the outset the question of our jurisdiction which is presented by a motion to dismiss the appeal. According to § 238 of the Judicial Code, appeal or error may be prosecuted from the District Court when their jurisdiction is in issue; in prize cases; in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States; in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty is drawn in question; in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*341</span> any case in which the constitution or law of a State is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p>It is manifest that the present case falls within none of the enumerated cases whether the regulations of the Associations be regarded as an exercise of the power which, it is contended, Congress alone possesses, or which has been conferred upon the Shipping Commission, or be regarded as violations of the Anti-Trust Law.</p>\n<p>If, however, appellant received a justiciable injury from the regulations which the judgment of the District Court did not recognize, review of that action must be through the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and, therefore, in compliance with § 238(a) of the Judicial Code<sup>[1]</sup> (42 Stat. 837), the case must be transferred to that court.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  \"If an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, any circuit court of appeals in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to or issued out of the Supreme Court; or if an appeal or writ of error has been or shall be taken to, or issued out of, the Supreme Court in a case wherein such appeal or writ of error should have been taken to, or issued out of, a circuit court of appeals, such appeal or writ of error shall not for such reason be dismissed, but shall be transferred to the proper court, . . .\"</p>\n\n</div>",
