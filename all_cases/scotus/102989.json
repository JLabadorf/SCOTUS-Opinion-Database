Respondent contends that the Revenue Act of 1932<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> indicated Congressional intent to designate the date of allowance of a refund (the date the Commissioner signs the schedule of overassessments) as the date of refund for computation the period of limitations under section 610.

This Act in no manner relates to limitations on suits for erroneous refunds. It has no purpose in common with section 610 of the 1928 Act. The 1932 Act throws no light on the meaning of section 610.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 610 is clear when its words are given their commonly accepted import. 'Congress may well be supposed to have used language in accordance with the common understanding.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d Ed., Unabridged, defines 'refund' as 'that which is refunded' and defines the transitive verb as: 'to return (money) in restitution, repayment * * *.' Only by ignoring the common understanding of words could 'making * * * (a) refund' be considered synonymous with 'allowing a refund.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Congress had in mind the separate and distinct meanings of these two expressions is clearly demonstrated in House Report No. 2, 70th Congress, 1st Session, pages 34, 35, containing the Committee Report on the Revenue Act of 1928:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The section (610) provides that any erroneous refund, * * * may be recovered by suit brought in the name of the United States if such suit is begun within two years after the making of the refund.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately following, in referring to section 614, 26 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1671 and note the Report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The principal change made in existing law is that in the case of a refund the interest period now terminates with the allowance of the refund, a date which often precedes the actual making of the refund * * *.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner's signature on a schedule of overassessments does not finally establish a claimant's right to a refund and does not preclude further investigation and consideration of the claim.

Obviously, the Government had no right to sue this taxpayer to recover money before money had been paid to him. The construction urged by respondent would allowed the statute of limitations to begin to run against recovery on an erroneous payment before any such payment is made. As said by a House Committee in reporting on a statute of limitations contained in a revenue act,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> 'Logically the period of limitation should run from the date of payment, since it is at that time that the right accrues.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are of opinion that Congress did not intend the limitations of section 610 to run against the Government until the Government's right 'has accrued in a shape to be effectually enforced.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statute does not begin to run against the Government when a claim is erroneously allowed.

It has no purpose in common with § 610 of the 1928 Act. The 1932 Act throws no light on the meaning of § 610.</p>\n<p>Section 610 is clear when its words are given their commonly accepted import. \"Congress may well be supposed to have used language in accordance with the common understanding.\"<sup>[7]</sup> Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed., Unabridged) defines \"refund\" as \"that which is refunded\" and defines the transitive verb as: \"to return (money) in restitution, repayment. . .\" Only by ignoring the common understanding of words could \"making . . . [a] refund\" be considered synonymous with \"allowing a refund.\"</p>\n<p>That Congress had in mind the separate and distinct meanings of these two expressions is clearly demonstrated in House Report No. 2, 70th Congress, 1st Session, p. 34, 35, containing the Committee Report on the Revenue Act of 1928:</p>\n<p>\"The section (610) provides that any erroneous refund, . . . may be recovered by suit brought in the name of the United States if such suit is begun within two years <i>after the making of the refund.\"</i></p>\n<p>Immediately following, in referring to § 614, the Report stated:</p>\n<p>\"The principal change made in existing law is that in the case of a refund the interest period now terminates <i>with the allowance of the refund, a date which often precedes the actual making of the refund</i> . . .\"</p>\n<p>The Commissioner's signature on a schedule of overassessments does not finally establish a claimant's right to a refund and does not preclude further investigation and consideration of the claim. The Commissioner could later take his signature from the schedule and as pointed out by this Court might  even after a check was signed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*418</span> and mailed  cancel the payment and revoke the authority of payment erroneously made.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>It would require language so clear as to leave room for no other reasonable construction in order to induce the belief that Congress intended a statute of limitations to begin to run before the right barred by it has accrued. Obviously, the Government had no right to sue this taxpayer to recover money before money had been paid to him. The construction urged by respondent would allow the statute of limitations to begin to run against recovery on an erroneous payment before any such payment is made. As said by a House Committee in reporting on a statute of limitations contained in a revenue act,<sup>[9]</sup> \"Logically the period of limitation should run from the date of payment, since it is at that time that the right accrues.\"</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that Congress did not intend the limitations of § 610 to run against the Government until the Government's right \"has accrued in a shape to be effectually enforced.\"<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>This statute does not begin to run against the Government when a claim is erroneously allowed. It begins to run from the date of payment. The judgment below is not in accord with this construction of the statute and is</p>\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO and MR.
