Section 4 makes it the duty of the commission to regulate the transportation, to prescribe rules for safety of carriers' operations, and to supervise all matters affecting relationships between the carriers and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#167; 206(a), declares that no common carrier by motor vehicle subject to its provisions shall engage in interstate commerce unless there is in force with respect to such carrier a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing the operation. A proviso in that section declares that, if any such carrier 'was in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935,' over routes for which application is made and has so operated since that time, the commission shall issue the certificate without requiring further proof that public convenience and necessity will be served by the carrier's operation.

Claiming to have been in bona fide operation as contemplated by the proviso, he made timely application to the Interstate Commerce Commission for a certificate authorizing him to continue to operate over the highways he has been using. The application is still pending, and petitioner insists that, notwithstanding state law, he is entitled to continue operations under the proviso. The question first to be decided is whether his claim of bona fide operation is well founded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May of 1934 he applied to the state commission for a certificate authorizing operation as a common carrier in interstate commerce. July 14, 1934, the commission denied the application on the ground that the proposed operations would subject the highways named in it to excessive burden and endanger and interfere with ordinary use by the public. Petitioner appealed to the district court of Travis county and obtained a decree enjoining the commission from interfering with his operations. The Court of Civil Appeals, January 8, 1936, reversed and dissolved the injunction. Railroad Commission v. McDonald, 90 S.W.2d 581. Thus it appears that petitioner's operations have been without authority of the Texas Commission and, unless within the proviso of the federal Act, without authority of federal law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exact definition of 'bona fide operation' is not necessary. As the Act is remedial and to be construed liberally, the proviso defining exemptions is to be read in harmony with the purpose of the measure and held to extend only to carriers plainly within its terms. Piedmont &amp; Northern Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., 286 U.S. 299, 311, 52 S.Ct. 541, 545, 76 L.Ed. 1115. To limit the meaning to mere physical operation would be to eliminate 'bona fide'. That would be contrary to the rule that all words of a statute are to be taken into account and given effect if that can be done consistently with the plainly disclosed legislative intent. Ginsberg &amp; Sons v. Poplin, 285 U.S. 204, 208, 52 S.Ct. 322, 323, 76 L.Ed. 704; Ginsberg &amp; Sons v. Popkin, 285 U.S. 49 S.Ct. 43, 44, 73 L.Ed. 202. There is nothing to justify rejection of these qualifying words. The expression, 'in bona fide operation', suggests absence of evasion, excludes the idea that mere ability to serve as a common carrier is enough, includes actual rather than potential or simulated service, and in context implies recognition of the power of the State to withhold or condition the use of its highways in the business of transportation for hire. Plainly the proviso does not extend to one operating as a common carrier on public highways of a State in defiance of its laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As petitioner is not protected in his operation as a common carrier by the proviso, we need not consider to what extent, if at all, the federal Motor Carrier Act superseded the state Motor Truck Law, or any other question presented by petitioner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Acts Reg.Sess., 42d Leg., 1931, c. 277, Vernon's Tex.Ann.Civ.St. Art. 911b.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Act of August 9, 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 551, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 306(a), 49 U.S.C.A. &#167; 306(a).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
