Ellis and S. B. Axtell, both of New York City, for petitioner.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Argument of Counsel from pages 151-153 intentionally omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Cletus Keating, of New York City, for respondent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plamals, the petitioner, a subject of Spain, belonged to the crew of the British ship Pinar Del Rio. She was anchored at Philadelphia April 27, 1923. He was being hoisted up to paint the smokestack; a rope broke; he fell to the deck and sustained serious injuries. The accident resulted from the negligence of the mate, who selected a defective rope. An abundant supply of good rope was on board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months after the accident, Plamals began this proceeding in rem against the ship in the District Court, Southern District of New York. The libel alleged that his injuries 'were due to the fault or neglect of the said steamship or those in charge of her, in that the said rope was old, worn, and not suitable for use, in that libelant was ordered to perform services not within the scope of his duties, and in other respects that libelant will point out on the trial of this action.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing to show that painting the smokestack was beyond the scope of the duties assumed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the District Court the petitioner asserted by his proctor that he claimed under section 33, Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007 (46 USCA &#167; 688; Comp. St. &#167; 8337a) which follows; that section 20 of such Act of March 4, 1925, be, and is, amended to read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Sec. 20. That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in      the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain      an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by      jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States      modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in      cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply;      and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any      such personal injury the personal representative of such      seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the      right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of      the United States conferring or regulating the right of      action for death in the case of railway employees shall be      applicable. Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the      court of the district in which the defendant employer resides or in which his principal office      is located.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court ruled that the rights and liabilities of the parties were fixed by the law of the ship's flag, and was of opinion that the British Workmen's Compensation Act afforded the only remedy. It accordingly dismissed the libel. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that a lien against the vessel is essential to every proceeding in rem against her, and that no such lien arose by reason of section 33 of the Jones Act in favor of the injured seaman. Upon that ground it affirmed the questioned decree. 16 F.(d) 984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and find it unnecessary now to consider whether the provisions of section 33 are applicable where a foreign seaman employed on a foreign ship suffers injuries while in American waters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record does not support the suggestion that the Pinar Del Rio was unseaworthy.

They imposed personal liability, and gave no lien of any kind. The statute which extended them to seamen expressly provided that the employer might be sued only in the district where he resides or has his principal office. This provision repels the suggestion that the intention was to subject the ship to in rem proceedings.
