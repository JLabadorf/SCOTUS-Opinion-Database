Acting under Act No. 85 of 1921, as amended by Act No. 175 of 1929, the secretary of state calculated, and appellee confirmed his determinations, that appellant was liable for a license fee tax of $3,000 for 1929 and $2,935.95 for 1930. Appellant obtained a review in the state Supreme Court, and there maintained, as it still insists, that by its articles of association its powers are limited to constructing, owning, maintaining, and operating the bridge for the use of traffic and to taking tolls therefor, that in 1930 it was engaged exclusively in foreign commerce, and that the statute, construed to impose a fee for the privilege of doing that business, violates the commerce clause. The bridge was under construction during a part of 1929, and no question is here presented as to the fee for that year. The court overruled appellant's contention, and, except as to an item not now material, entered judgment affirming the determination of the fees. 257 Mich. 52, 240 N.W. 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole question is whether as construed the state law violates the commerce clause (Const.

It is the intent of this section to impose the tax herein provided for upon every corporation, foreign or domestic, having the privilege of exercising corporate franchises within this state, irrespective of whether any such corporation chooses to actually exercise such privilege during any taxable period.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Re Detroit Properties Corp. (1931) 254 Mich. 523, at page 525, 236 N.W. 850, 851, the state Supreme Court held: 'The privilege fee is an excise tax, not upon the right to be a corporation, but upon the activities of the corporation in the exercise of its corporate franchise, or, as it is sometimes expressed, upon the franchise 'to do,' not upon the franchise 'to be.' * * * Actual transaction of business by a domestic corporation is not a condition of the tax. It is imposed on the right to transact.' And this court follows that construction. Michigan v.

We do not consider whether appellant is engaged in foreign commerce, for we are of opinion that it has failed to establish that it has no power to carry on any business that is not within the protection of the commerce clause.

Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., 270 U.S. 402, 410, 46 S.Ct. 320, 70 L.Ed. 654. The record contains only a part of the third article of its articles of association: 'The purpose or purposes of this corporation are as follows: To construct, own and/or operate a highway bridge across the Detroit River from Detroit, Michigan, to Sandwich Province of Ontario, Canada, and the approaches thereto; To maintain and operate such bridge and the approaches thereto for the use of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and to charge and collect tolls for such use.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts that its powers are solely limited to these purposes.

It is clear that, in addition to general power to own and operate the bridge and to do all that is related to that enterprise, appellant is by the last-quoted provision empowered, as contended by appellee, to carry on the business of buying and selling real and personal property within the state of Michigan and elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, appellant did not at first claim that its powers and activities are limited to foreign commerce.
