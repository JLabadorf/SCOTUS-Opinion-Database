Respondent was appointed his administratrix and, electing under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, &#167; 33 (33 U.S.C. &#167; 933 (33 USCA &#167; 933)) to assert her claim against a third party, filed a libel in admiralty in the district court of Oregon against the ship, claiming on behalf of his estate damages in the sum of $10,000.

Oregon Code 1930, &#167; 5-703. And the Oregon Boat Lien Law declares that every boat or vessel shall be subject to a lien 'for damages or injuries (done) by such boat or vessel resulting in the death of any person.'

The sole question is whether the happening of the fatal event upon navigable waters gave the admiralty court jurisdiction notwithstanding death occurred on land. The right to recover for death depends upon the law of the place of the act or omission that caused it and not upon that of the place where death occurred. Van Doren v. Pennsylvania R. Co.

But it argued that, as no claim was made for injuries there sustained and that as the suit was solely for death, the case was exclusively within the admiralty jurisdiction. We said (page 182 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 228, 229, 72 L.Ed. 520): 'But this is a partial view that cannot be sustained. The blow by the sling was what gave rise to the cause of action.
