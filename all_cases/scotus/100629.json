The fund derived from conversion of all the property is insufficient fully to satisfy taxes due the United States and the city and county of San Francisco, and the allowed claims for preferred wages. Which of these must be paid first is the question for decision. The referee ruled in favor of the wages, and the District Court approved; but the Circuit Court of Appeals held to the contrary, and directed that priority should be given the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 544, 563, c. 541 (Comp.

The court shall order      the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing by the      bankrupt to the United States, state, county, district, or      municipality in advance of the payment of dividends to      creditors, and upon filing the receipts of the proper public      officers for such payment he shall be credited with the      amount thereof, and in case any question arises as to the      amount or legality of any such tax the same shall be heard      and determined by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'b.

Title Guarnaty Co., 224 U. S. 152, 159, 160, 32 S. Ct. 457, 459 (56 L. Ed. 706), held that under section 64 wages were entitled to priority over the claim of the United States for damages occasioned by the bankrupt's failure to comply with a construction contract. It was there said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'By the statute of 1797 (now section 3466), and section 5101      of the Revised Statutes, all debts due to the United States      were expressly given priority to the wages due any operative,      clerk or house servant. A different order is prescribed by      the act of 1898, and something more. Labor claims are given      priority, and it is provided that debts having priority shall      be paid in <i>full</i>. The only exception is 'taxes legally due and      owing by the bankrupt to the United States, state, county,      district or municipality.' These were civil obligations, not      personal conventions, and preference was given to them, but      as to debts we must assume a change of purpose in the change      of order And we cannot say that it was inadvertent. The act      takes into consideration, we think, the whole range of      indebtedness of the bankrupt, national, state and individual,      and assigns the order of payment. The policy which dictated      it was beneficent and well might induce a postponement of the      claims, even of the sovereign in favor of those who      necessarily depended upon their daily labor. And to give such      claims priority could in no case seriously affect the      sovereign. To deny them priority would in all cases seriously      affect the claimants.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In City of Richmond v.

Ed. 543, past-due taxes were denied priority of payment over a debt secured by a lien which the state law recognized as superior to the city's claim for such taxes. We said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Respondents therefore must prevail unless priority over      their lien is given by section 64a to claim for taxes which, under state law, occupied no better position than one      held by a general creditor. Section 67d, Bankruptcy Act,      quoted supra, declares that liens given or accepted in good      faith and not in contemplation of or in fraud upon this act,      shall not be affected by it. Other provisions must, of      course, be construed in view of this positive one. Section      64a directs that taxes be paid in advance of dividends to      creditors; and 'dividend.' as commonly used throughout the      act, means partial payment to general creditors. In section      65b, for example, the word occurs in contrast to payment of      debts which have priority. And as the local laws gave no      superior right to the city's unsecured claim for taxes we are      unable to conclude that Congress intended by section 64a to      place it ahead of valid lienholders.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">iOf course, this opinion must be read in the light of the question under consideration: Does section 64 require that taxes shall be paid in advance of debts secured by liens which under the local law are superior to claims for such taxes? We pointed out that section 67d (Comp. St. &#167; 9651) preserves valid liens and is not qualified by the direction of section 64a to discharge taxes 'in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors,' since \"dividend,' as commonly used throughout the act, means partial payment to general creditors.'
