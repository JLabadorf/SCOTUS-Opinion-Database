In these two cases the Tax Court held that recoveries by these taxpayers in 1939 did constitute taxable income. It held, also, that the recovery was taxable as ordinary income, despite taxpayer's contention that it should be taxed as capital gain under Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, &#167; 117.

Harwick asserted a claim, and the three other taxpayers involved in these cases filed suit, against the National City Company, demanding rescission of their purchases of stock. Their claims were compromised or admitted; the taxpayers seek to link the recoveries resulting therefrom with their prior sales of the stock, which resulted in losses. The Tax Court did not find as matter of fact, and we decline to say as matter of law, that such a transaction is a 'sale or exchange' of a capital asset in the accepted meaning of those terms. Cf. Helvering v. Flaccus Leather Co., 313 U.S. 247, 61 S.Ct. 878, 85 L.Ed. 1310; Fairbanks v. United States, 306 U.S. 436, 59 S.Ct. 607, 83 L.Ed. 855. In Helvering v.
