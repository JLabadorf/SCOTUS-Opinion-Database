A judgment on the order in favor of the defendant in error was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. New York &amp; Pennsylvania Co. v. New York Cent. R. Co., 126 A. 382, 281 Pa. 257. The charges in question were for shipments between March 1, 1920, and September 1, 1920, the six months following the termination of federal control of the railroads. The rates charged were those that were in effect on February 29, 1920. By section 208(a) of the Transportation Act 1920 (Act Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91; 41 Stat. 456, 464 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, &#167; 10071 1/4 d)), prior to September 1, 1920, no such rate could be reduced unless the reduction was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the six months concerned being the period during which the United States guaranteed certain income to the railroads by section 209 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, &#167; 10071 1/4 dd). The Interstate Commerce Commission has not approved any reduction and therefore it is plain that the State Commission had no authority to intermeddle with the rates that it undertook to cut down. It is true that regulating rates and awarding reparation are different matters. But the prohibition in the statute covers either method of reducing the pay received by the roads. The language of the statute and the reasons for the enactment too clearly apply to intrastate as well as to interstate rates, to admit debate. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Boone, 46 S. Ct. 341, 270 U. S. 466, 70 L. Ed. 688, March 22, 1926.

Whether the federal rights asserted were lost in this way is open to examination here. Creswill v. Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias, 32 S. Ct. 822, 225 U. S. 246, 56 L. Ed. 1074; Ward v.

We do not undertake to review the decision of the Supreme Court as to state procedure, but if the railroads were too late to argue their case before that Court they are not too late to argue it here. There was no order in the former hearing before the State Commission that the railroads could have brought before us. This is the first moment when they have had a chance to raise what we regard as a perfectly clear point, as it is the first moment when their rights have been infringed. There now is an order which is in the teeth of the statute. It would not be reasonable to hold that they are precluded from getting the protection that this Court owes them, by their having failed to go as far as they now learn that they might have gone in a previous state proceeding which did not infringe their rights and which could not be brought here.
