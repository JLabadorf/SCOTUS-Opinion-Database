S. 499, 48 S. Ct. 113, 72 L. Ed. &#8212;, against Abraham S. Gilbert, of New York, a member of the bar of this court, directing him to report concerning fees or allowances to him as master in a number of causes known as the New York Gas Cases, in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, exceeding the maximum amount which had been held by this court on review of the cases to be permissible, although our decision was announced in the October term, 1921. Newton V. East River Gas Co., 259 U. S. 101, 42 S. Ct. 438, 66 L. Ed. 844. Gilbert was required to show cause why on this account his name should not be stricken from the roll of attorneys permitted to practice in this court, or he be punished for contempt or otherwise dealt with as the circumstances required. On the return day, January 16th, he presented himself and was heard by counsel. On January 23d, this court announced in an opinion 276 U. S. 10, 48 S. Ct. 210, 72 L. Ed. 441, in which the facts were set forth, that it was Gilbert's duty, without further delay, to return the excess, with interest thereon at 6 per cent. from May 15, 1922, and further action was then postponed until Monday, February 20, 1928. On that day the respondent presented himself and submitted canceled checks and receipts showing his payment of the excess to the parties litigant entitled thereto, with interest as ordered, the aggregate being $92,744.32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case now comes on for final action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his answer the respondent suggests that he had never had any opportunity on his own behalf to show by hearing and argument the justice of the compensation awarded to him by the District Court, and seeks to raise doubt as to the conclusion we reached, that the allowance made to him was an abuse of discretion by the District Court. Our conclusion was the result of a careful examination of the statement made by the then referee, the present respondent, as to the labor he had performed, and after full consideration. We were desirous of making it clear by our action that the judges of the courts, in fixing allowances for services to court officers, should be most careful, and that vicarious generosity in such a matter could receive no countenance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The respondent further says:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'In reversing the orders appealed from, this court made no      order or direction which required me to return the excess fee      that had already been paid me by the gas companies. Neither      the District Judge, who entered the orders in compliance with      the mandate of this court, nor counsel for the gas companies,      nor counsel for any of the defendants, ever even suggested      that the decision or mandate of this court required the entry      of orders by the District Court Judge directing the return by      me of the excess fees to the gas companies, which had      willingly paid them in the first instance and had believed      them to be fair in amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Upon receipt of the mandate of this court, the District      Court, upon notice to all parties, without any action on my      part, and without any appearance by me, entered the order in      the Consolidated Gas Case, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(1) The judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States      if hereby made in all respects the judgment of this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"(2) The compensation of A.

But, instead of coming to the tribunal which had authoritatively decided the matter, Gilbert relied on the tolerance and favor of the litigant companies, in whose favor on the merits of the case he had decided the issue, not to move for compliance with our decision. This was the front of his wrongdoing. He persisted further by a futile proceeding in a New York state court to secure a declaratory judgment that he owed nothing to the litigant companies, although such an obligation to pay them was the necessary effect of our decision and the existing facts known to him. In that proceeding he evidently relied again on the friendly attitude of the litigant companies and their acquiescence, though against their pecuniary interest.
