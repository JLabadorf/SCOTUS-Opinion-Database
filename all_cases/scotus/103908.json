There was no allegation that Johnson rendered any labor or service in consequence of the arrest. From a judgment sustaining a demurrer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the United States appealed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charge is laid under &#167; 269 of the Criminal Code,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> which is: 'Whoever holds, arrests, returns, or causes to be held, arrested, or returned, or in any manner aids in the arrest or return of any person to a condition of peonage, shall be fined * * * or imprisoned * * *.'</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court held that the statute imposes no penalty for an arrest with intent to compel the performance of labor or service unless the person arrested renders labor or service for a master following the arrest.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\r\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\r\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this was error. Section 269 derives from &#167; 1 of the Act of March 2, 1867,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which abolished and prohibited the system known as peonage in any territory or state, nullified any law, ordinance, regulation, or usage inconsistent with the prohibition, and added criminal sanctions in the language now constituting &#167; 269.

The appropriate qualifying preposition for the word 'holds' is 'in'. An accurate qualifying phrase for the verb 'arrests' would be 'to place in or return to' peonage. But the compactness of phrasing and the lack of strict grammatical construction does not obscure the intent of the Act.

And in order to reach the opposite conclusion, this Court labels the statutory language as \"inartistic\" and as lacking in \"strict grammatical construction.\" It then proceeds to rewrite the statute, in conformity with what it conceives to have been the original intention of Congress, so as to penalize \"whoever . . . arrests . . . any person for the purpose of placing him in a condition of peonage.\" I cannot assent to this judicial revision of a criminal law. Congress alone has power to amend or clarify the criminal sanctions of a statute.</p>\n<p>Apologia for inadequate legislative draftsmanship and reliance on the admitted evils of peonage cannot replace the right of each individual to a fair warning from Congress as to those actions for which penalties are inflicted. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*531</span> Punishment without clear legislative authority might conceivably contain more potential seeds of oppression than the arrest of a person \"to a condition of peonage.\"</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
