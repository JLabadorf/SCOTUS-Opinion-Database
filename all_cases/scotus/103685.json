Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, 245 I.C.C. 11, requiring the appellant railroads to cease and desist from maintaining certain absorption rules and practices found to be unduly discriminatory and unreasonable and therefore offensive to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1(6), 3(1), 15(1), 49 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 1(6), 3(1), 15(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon complaint of the Minneapolis Traffic Association, representing grain interests in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin, the Commission instituted an inquiry into the practices of the rail carriers at the complaining markets with respect to absorption of connecting-line switching charges on so-called noncompetitive or local shipments (i.e., originating at points served by only one railroad) of grain, grain products, and seeds. After extensive hearings the Commission found that at the complaining markets the railroads generally absorbed the switching charges on competitive traffic (i.e., originating at points served by more than one railroad) but not on noncompetitive or local traffic, while at all other markets in central-western territory the carriers absorbed the switching charges on both competitive and noncompetitive shipments. This practice, the Commission concluded, was wholly at variance with the general purpose of the grain-rate structure to bring about 'an adjustment under which the rates to and from all western markets would be on relatively the same level, or an adjustment under which the rates to and from the markets would approximate a mileage parity.' 245 I.C.C. 11, 13. It was further found that the carriers' absorption practices at the complaining markets were supported neither by revenue considerations nor sound transportation factors, and that the widespread absorption of switching charges on noncompetitive traffic at other important markets was strong evidence of the reasonableness of such practice and of the unreasonableness of the carriers' refusal to absorb such charges at the complaining markets. Upon the basis of these findings the Commission entered the order challenged on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the validity of the Commission's findings nor its compliance with procedural safeguards is assailed here.

Section 3(1) makes it unlawful for common carriers to give 'any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, * * * locality, * * * region, district, territory, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever; or to subject any particular person, * * * locality, * * * region, district, territory, or any particular description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever * * *.' Section 15(1) authorizes and empowers the Commission, upon finding that a practice of carriers is 'unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory', to make an appropriate cease-and-desist order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are of opinion that these statutory provisions furnish ample authority for the order made here by the Commission.
