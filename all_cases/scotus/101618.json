Respondent was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, and demanded a trial by jury. The demand was denied, and he was put upon trial before the judge without a jury and found guilty. Upon writ of error the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the judgment, holding that respondent, under the federal Constitution, was entitled to a jury trial. With that conclusion we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The acts of Congress passed for the government of the District provide that prosecutions in the police court shall be on information; that where the accused would be entitled to a jury trial under the Constitution, trial shall be by jury unless waived; and that in cases where the accused would not by force of the Constitution be entitled to a trial by jury, trial shall be by the court without a jury, unless, in cases where the fine or penalty may be more than $300 or imprisonment more than ninety days, the accused shall demand a trial by jury, in which case the trial shall be by jury.

C. Code, outlined above, the Constitution is made the test-as, of course, it must be-to determine whether the accused be entitled to a jury trial. Article 3, &#167; 2, cl. 3, of the Constitution provides that, 'The Trial of all Crimes, exceptin  Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury.' This provision is to be interpreted in the light of the common law, according to which petty offenses might be proceeded against summarily before a magistrate sitting without a jury. See Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 557, 8 S. Ct. 1301, 32 L. Ed. 223. That there may be many offenses called 'petty offenses' which do not rise to the degree of crimes within the meaning of article 3, and in respect of which Congress may dispense with a jury trial, is settled. Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65, 24 S. Ct. 826, 49 L. Ed. 99, 1 Ann. Cas. 585. And see Natal v. Louisiana, 139 U. S. 621, 624, 11 S. Ct. 636, 35 L. Ed. 288; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133, 141, 14 S. Ct. 499, 38 L. Ed. 385; State v. Rodgers, 91 N. J.

The offense here charged is not merely malum prohibitum, but in its very nature is malum in se. It was an indictable offense at common law, United States v. John Hart, Pet. C. C. 390, 392, Fed. Cas. No. 15, 316, when horses, instead of gasoline, constituted the motive power. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, in State v. Rodgers, supra, has discussed the distinction between traffic offenses of a petty character, subject to summary proceedings without indictment and trial by jury, and those of a serious character, amounting to public nuisances indictable at common law; and its examination of the subject makes clear that the offense now under review is of the latter character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An automobile is, potentially, a dangerous instrumentality, as the appalling number of fatalities brought about every day by its operation bear distressing witness. To drive such an instrumentality through the public streets of a city so recklessly 'as to endanger property and individuals' is an act of such obvious depravity that to characterize it as a petty offense would be to shock the general moral sense. If the act of the respondent described in the information had culminated in the death of a human being, respondent would have been subject to indictment for some degree of felonious homicide. Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373, 377, 33 S. Ct. 780, 57 L. Ed. 1232; 1 Whar, Cr. Law, &#167;&#167; 343 et seq., 353-356; 1 Bish, New Cr. Law, &#167; 313 et seq.; Story v. United States, 57 App. D. C. 3, 16 F.(2d) 342, 344, 53 A. L. R. 246; State v. Campbell, 82 Conn, 671, 677, 74 A. 927, 135 Am. St. Rep. 293, 18 Ann. Cas. 236; Mercer v. Corbin, 117 Ind. 450, 20 N. E. 132, 3 L. R.

Such an act properly cannot be described otherwise than as a grave offense-a crime within the meaning of the third article of the Constitution-and as such within the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
