He appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, and filed August 14, 1936&#8212;forty assignments of error. The judgment of conviction was affirmed March 6, 1937, upon an opinion, 9 Cir., 88 F.2d 591, 594, which, among other things, states: 'Twenty-eight assignments (numbered 5, 9 to 25, inclusive, and 31 to 40, inclusive) are to the admission of and refusal to strike out evidence. The assignments do not indicate that any of this evidence was objected to in the trial court. They do not state what objections, if any, were made, nor the grounds thereof, nor the grounds, if any, on which appellant moved to strike out the evidence. Such assignments do not conform to our rule 11 and will not be considered. Cody v. United States (C.C.A.9) 73 F.(2d) 180, 184; Goldstein v. United States (C.C.A.9) 73 F.(2d) 804, 806.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ruling we think was error.

United States, 1934, 9 Cir., 73 F.2d 804, 806, declared: 'The assignment of error must not only quote 'the full substance of the evidence admitted or rejected,' but it must also state the error asserted and intended to be urged. This requires that the objection and ruling of the court upon the objection and the exception to the ruling be incorporated in the assignment of error.' Adhering to this interpretation, the court persistently refused to consider assignments deemed not in conformity therewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between the appeal and announcement of the opinion under consideration, rule 11 was amended so as to provide: 'When the error alleged is to the admission or rejection of evidence the assignment of error shall quote the ground urged at the trial for the objection and the exception taken and the full substance of the evidence admitted or rejected.' Manifestly petitioner had the right to rely upon the rule, properly construed, as it stood at the time of his appeal&#8212;before the amendment. And if analysis of one of the rejected assignments discloses substantial compliance, the cause must go back for further consideration of the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Litigants may not be deprived of a hearing upon their points by wrongful construction of rules nor by their arbitrary application.
