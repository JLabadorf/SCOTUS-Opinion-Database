When, as in the instant case, joint-stock land banks are affiliated with banking corporations that do <span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> have taxable incomes, the question assumes importance, as the interest deduction, if allowed, reduces the tax liability of the affiliated group  even then, however, it in no way affects the joint-stock land banks included in such consolidation. They have no taxable income and they pay no taxes.\"</p>\n<p>Considering the circumstances, we find no reason to conclude that Congress intended to permit any ordinary commercial bank, with income subject to taxation, to secure partial relief therefrom through affiliation with a Joint Stock Land Bank. That result would follow approval of the petitioner's position.</p>\n<p>In <i>Denman</i> v. <i>Slayton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101666\"><a href=\"/opinion/101666/denman-v-slayton/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, we said  \"The manifest purpose of the exception in paragraph 2, § 214 (a), was to prevent the escape from taxation of income properly subject thereto by the purchase of exempt securities with borrowed money.\"</p>\n<p>The Federal Farm Loan Act (§§ 16 and 13) empowers Joint Stock Land Banks to invest their funds \"in the purchase of qualified first mortgages on farm lands.\" The obvious meaning is that loans might be made on such security. Loans, so made, become \"securities issued under the provisions of the\" Act and interest upon them is wholly exempt from taxation under Title II, Revenue Act of 1921.</p>\n<p>Interpreting the language of the exception in § 234 in view of the legislative purpose, we think that the farm mortgages owned by the affiliated Joint Stock Land Banks must be regarded as \"obligations or securities . . . the interest upon which is wholly exempt from taxation under this title,\" and that the bonds issued by them constituted indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry such obligations.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
