He alleged: That on February 2, 1920, while employed by the Robins Company and doing repair work on the steamer El Occident, then lying in navigable waters at Brooklyn, a plank scaffold on which he was walking or standing broke and caused him to fall into the hold. That he sustained serious injuries caused solely by and through negligence in that the company did not furnish a safe place to work and failed to provide a safe scaffold as required by the labor laws of the state of New York, but negligently and carelessly furnished an unsafe, inadequate and unsuitable scaffold and plank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This is what we call a maritime tort, an action in      negligence that is governed by the maritime laws, the      admiralty laws, the laws that pertain to navigable waters in      this country. * * * The law permits even a maritime case,      such as should ordinarily be brought in the United States      court, to be tried in a state court. But the maritime law is      applied, and those maritime laws are known by lawyers as the      common law. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Under the common law the same rule applies in this case as      the rules that I have laid down to you, that the burden is      upon the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was negligent,      and that he himself was free from any contributory      negligence. In this case, however, comes a provision known as      section 18 of the Labor Law, and section 18 of the Labor Law      [Consol. Laws, c. 31] reads as follows: 'A person employing      or directing another to perform labor of any kind in the      erection, repairing, altering or painting of a house,      building or structure shall not furnish or erect, or cause to      be furnished or erected for the performance of such labor,      scaffolding, hoists, stays, ladders or other mechanical      contrivances which are unsafe, unsuitable or improper, and      which are not so constructed, placed and operated as to give      proper protection to the life and limb of a person so      employed or engaged.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The decisions hold that section 18 of the Labor Law does not      make an employer, as we term him, the 'master,' in this case      the defendant, an insurer of the scaffold&#8212;and this plank      within the meaning of the law is a scaffold&#8212;it does not make      the master an insurer of the safety of the scaffold under all      conditions; it requires the scaffold to be so safe as to give      proper protection to the workmen engaged in their duty.      However careful the master, he is responsible unless the      scaffold is in fact a proper one, proper to protect the      workman in the performance of his work. No law of the state      can modify or affect the rights of workmen who are operating under the maritime law. And it      has been held that this section 18 of the Labor Law does not      modify or affect the law, but may be read in conjunction with      the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And as I understand the law to be, in determining in this      case whether the defendant was negligent&#8212;for the plaintiff      must still prove that the defendant was negligent&#8212;you must      have in mind that there was in existence in the state a law      which imposed upon the defendant the burden and the necessity      of providing a scaffold that was proper for the workman to      work upon. And in this case, in the light of that law, you      must determine whether the defendant knowing the law, as it      was called upon to know it, acted negligently, and whether or      not the plaintiff has proved, by a fair preponderance of      evidence, that it acted negligently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If you find that in view of section 18 of the Labor Law the      defendant did act negligently, then you go to the next      proposition. If you find that it did not act negligently,      that ends this case, and you must render a verdict in favor      of the defendant. Assuming, for the purpose of bringing to      your attention all of the law in the case, that you find      under these circumstances the defendant was negligent then      you come to the next proposition, was the plaintiff free from      negligence that contributed to the injury. If he was free,      then he is entitled to a verdict.

Judgment went for plaintiff Dahl and this was approved upon appeal. The plaintiff in error maintains that the trial court committed material error by instructing the jury as above stated.

The rights and liabilities of the parties arose out of and depended upon the general maritime law and could not be enlarged or impaired by the state statute. Chelentis v. Luchenbach Steamship Co., 247 U. S. 372, 382, 38 S. Ct. 501, 62 L. Ed. 1171; Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, 248 U. S. 308, 39 S. Ct. 112, 63 L. Ed. 261; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U.
