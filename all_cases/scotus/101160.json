Ed. 218, decided this day, the plaintiff, Farina Bus Line &amp; Transportation Company, is an Illinois corporation; the defendant is the city of Hammond; the relief sought is an injunction to prevent the enforcement of Ordinance No. 1945, adopted May 23, 1925; and the relief was denied by the District Court, without finding any facts and without opinion. The Circuit Court of Appeals (11 F.(2d) 943) reversed the decree and remanded the case, with directions 'to enter a decree granting the injunction.' The decision was rendered on the same day on which that court rendered its decision in the Schappi Case. It, also, made no finding of facts.
