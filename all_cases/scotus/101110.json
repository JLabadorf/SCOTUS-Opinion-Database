The greater part of the bill proceeds on the theory that the diversion impairs the navigable capacity of the Great Lakes and the rivers leading from one lake to another and then to the Atlantic Ocean, and thereby obstructs and burdens commerce over these waterways to the serious injury of the plaintiff state and her people. To this part of the bill the defendants have answered, and evidence on the issues so framed has been or is being taken before a special master.

But it does not show that there is any present use of the waters for such purposes which is being or will be disturbed, nor that there is any definite project for so using them which is being or will be affected. The waters are international and their use for developing power may require the assent of the Dominion of Canada and the United States. No consent of either is shown. The suit is one for an injunction, a form or relief which must rest on an actual or presently threatened interference with the rights of another. Plainly no basis for such relief is disclosed in what is said about water power development. At best the paragraph does no more than present abstract questions respecting the right of the plaintiff state and her citizens to use the waters for such purposes in the indefinite future. We are not at liberty to consider abstract questions. New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 329, 46 S. Ct. 122, 70 L. Ed. 289. So the motion to strike out the paragraph must be sustained.
