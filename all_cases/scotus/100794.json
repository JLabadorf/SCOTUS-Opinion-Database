The board's action was approved and confirmed by Act of February 8, 1827, c. 9, 4 Stat. 202.

He had purchased the interests of all other heirs during 1893. April 23, 1896, patent for the 175 acres issued to Mary Ann Davis, but this was not delivered until 1898, because of protest by Venancio Sanchez, who claimed an interest.

About 1840 the husband of Mary Ann Davis sought to interest Sanchez, then and long afterwards a merchant at St. Augustine, Fla., in developing Key Biscayne.
