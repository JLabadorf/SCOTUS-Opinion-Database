The liability of the United States is established by the findings of the Court of Claims and is not disputed. Neither is there any dispute that the profits that the plaintiff would have made are a proper measure of the damages suffered. The Court of Claims, however, ruled that interest should not be allowed upon the amount so fixed, and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court upon that question. 282 U. S. 817, 51 S.

The statute grants 'recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use.' We are of opinion that interest should be allowed in order to make the compensation 'entire.' In addition to the purpose of the word adverted to in Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, 275 U. S. 331, 343, 48 S. Ct. 194, 72 L.
