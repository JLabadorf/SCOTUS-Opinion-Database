For many years it has carried on the business of insurance upon the assessment or mutual plan within the state of Ohio. May 4, 1882, it issued to respondent Langdale, aged 40, a certificate of membership, Safety Fund Department, for $3,000. This recites that in consideration of representations, etc., and 'the further payment in accordance with the conditions hereof of all mortuary assessments' the company agrees (among other things) to assess holders of certificates 'according to the table of graduated assessment rates given hereon, as determined by their respective ages and the number of such certificates in force,' and pay the amount so collected to the assured's legal representatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 'Table of Graduated Assessment Rates for Death Losses for Every $1,000 of a Total Indemnity of $1,000,000' is printed upon the certificate and shows increasing rates for ages from 15 to 60. The highest specified rate is at 60-$2.68.

To recover all above $2.68 per thousand so paid, with interest, respondent brought suit in the common pleas court, Franklin county, Ohio. The company appeared, demurred, and later answered, saving at all times the question of jurisdiction. A judgment against it was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 103 Ohio St. 398, 136 N.
