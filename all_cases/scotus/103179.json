The Commonwealth points to the provision of the Civil Code of Practice of Kentucky, Section 29,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> under which any person claiming an interest in property which has been attached may file his petition stating his claim and controverting that of the plaintiff in the attachment whereupon he may be made a defendant, his petition being treated as an answer.
