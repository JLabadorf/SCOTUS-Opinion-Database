He paid one-half, $1,489.39, the first installment, and then brought suit in the superior court of Sacramento county to recover $1,057.16, the amount imposed because of receipts under his contract for carrying the mails.

Under both sections taxes are laid according to gross receipts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges, in substance:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff is engaged in the business of operating an automotive stage line between Redding and Big Bear, Cal., by virtue of a contract entered into with the Post Office Department. The mails are carried by motor vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gross income derived from operating the line during 1926 follows: From carriage of passengers, $8,803.31; from carriage of freight, $9,806.43; from carriage of United States mail, $42,286.73.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon these receipts, the following tax was assessed for the year 1927: On gross income from passengers, $374.14; from freight, $490.32; from United States mail, $2,114.32. He paid one-half of the total sum so assessed, the first installment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In earning this revenue, plaintff  employed certain designated automotive property, and no other, the actual market value of which did not exceed $15,000. This was devoted chiefly to carrying the mails and had no value in excess of its actual market value; plaintiff's ability to earn more with it than other persons could with the same amount and character of property arose solely from the fact that he had a contract with the United States government for carrying the mails. Without this the stage line could not be operated profitably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assessment against the plaintiff is confiscatory, arbitrary, excessive, and does not take into consideration the actual value of the property involved, and was made without consideration of any element of value except the gross earnings. The tax rate on property assessed on an ad valorem basis in the counties where plaintiff operates did not exceed 3 per centum. Replacement value of all property used by him does not exceed $15,000. In carrying the mails he acted under a contract with the Post Office Department and was an agency of the United States not subject to local taxation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assessment, in so far as based upon the revenue derived from carrying the mails, was unlawful, and the portion of the first installment reckoned thereon and paid by plaintiff was unlawfully exacted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint; its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 208 Cal. 359, 281 P. 389. The latter held that the tax assessed against the petitioner is essentially one on property, and is neither confiscatory, nor so arbitrary as to impair any right under the Federal Constitution; also that the petitioner did not, through his contract to carry the mails, become an agency of the federal government immune from taxation computed according to gross receipts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record discloses no question relative to taxation of property outside the state or interference with interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of the state has declared the tax to be one upon property.

Ed. 329.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The California Constitution divides property within the state for taxation purposes into several classes, and provides for different burdens upon them. Thee can be no doubt of the general power of a state where there is reasonable ground therefor to classify property wholly within her limits and to lay an appropriate tax upon each class. Bekins Van Lines v. Riley, 280 U. S. 80, 82, 50 S. Ct. 64, 74 L. Ed. 178. It is not possible for us to say that the circumstances of the present cause disclose any arbitrary or unreasonable exertion of such power by the state. The distinction burdens upon them. There can be no a business which requires constant and unusual use of the highways and property not so employed is plain enough. Here the tax laid was exclusive of all other taxation, and the funds arising therefrom were assigned to the maintenance of roads, essential to petitioner's operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, petitioner is in no position to complain of an arbitrary exactment. The prescribed method of assessment was permissible, and the mere fact that he was required to pay a higher rate upon property devoted to his peculiar business than was demanded of property not so employed is unimportant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we think petitioner's property was entitled to exemption from state taxation because used in connection with the transportation of the mails. There was no tax upon the contract for such carriage; the burden laid upon the property employed affected operations of the federal government only remotely. UnionPac . Ry. Co. v.

Also by this court in <i>Pullman Co.</i> v. <i>Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1578327\"><a href=\"/opinion/1578327/pullman-co-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, and <i>Hopkins</i> v. <i>Southern California Tel. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101187\"><a href=\"/opinion/101187/hopkins-v-southern-cal-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The California Constitution divides property within the State for taxation purposes into several classes and provides for different burdens upon them. There can be no doubt of the general power of a State, where there is reasonable ground therefor, to classify property wholly within her limits and to lay an appropriate tax upon each class. <i>Bekins Van Lines</i> v. <i>Riley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101474\"><a href=\"/opinion/101474/bekins-van-lines-inc-v-riley/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 82. It is not possible for us to say that the circumstances of the present cause disclose any arbitrary or unreasonable exertion of such power by the State. The distinction between property employed in conducting a business which requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*514</span> constant and unusual use of the highways, and property not so employed, is plain enough. Here the tax laid was exclusive of all other taxation, and the funds arising therefrom were assigned to the maintenance of roads, essential to petitioner's operations.</p>\n<p>Certainly, petitioner is in no position to complain of an arbitrary exactment. The prescribed method of assessment was permissible, and the mere fact that he was required to pay a higher rate upon property devoted to his peculiar business than was demanded of property not so employed is unimportant.</p>\n<p>Nor do we think petitioner's property was entitled to exemption from state taxation because used in connection with the transportation of the mails. There was no tax upon the contract for such carriage; the burden laid upon the property employed affected operations of the Federal Government only remotely. <i>Railroad Co.</i> v. <i>Peniston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88789\"><a href=\"/opinion/88789/railroad-co-v-peniston/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 30; <i>Metcalf &amp; Eddy</i> v. <i>Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100771\"><a href=\"/opinion/100771/metcalf-eddy-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>.
