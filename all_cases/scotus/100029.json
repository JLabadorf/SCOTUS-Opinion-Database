Derbyshire in 1879 and inuring to its benefit under the following circumstances: The devise was subject to the payment of certain annuities. All of the annuitants are dead save one.

Derbyshire's Estate, 239 Pa. 389, 86 Atl. 878. The trustee transferred the whole residuary fund as a loan for 15 years to the Hospital, and secured himself by mortgage on property of the Hospital. Under the terms of the loan and mortgage, the Hospital only pays interest enough to satisfy the administrative charges and the annuity. It uses the remainder of the income from the fund for its expenses.
