A prominent one is, and it is variously expressed, that the express company was not heard in the classification of railroads; it being insisted that between the latter fact and the express business there is intimate relation, and therefore the same right of hearing to the express company as to railroads. But the fact of the classification of railroads was one that preceded the express company, of which it was aware, and was an element in the estimate of the privilege that was to be granted, for over the railroads the privilege could only be exercised. There was no element of judicial inquiry. The tax was the condition of a privilege to carry on a business&#8212;might, indeed, be denominated a license, but call it privilege or license, it was a condition the state could impose, and, having the option to impose it, could fix its amount directly or by reference to a standard.

The Supreme Court of the state found reasons for the difference, and there is certainly a difference between railroads and express companies of themselves, and necessarily in their relations to their respective businesses, and, against the action of the state and the judgment of its courts, the difference cannot be regarded as not of legal consideration in the imposition of an excise upon the express companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further urged that there is a discrimination offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in the laws of Mississippi permitting damages against the express company in an amount equal to the privilege tax, because it failed to pay the tax before entering May 1, 1921, while other companies, persons, and corporations already in business are allowed 30 days after the taxes accrue annually within which to pay them.

Robertson succeeded in his appeal: the Express Company failed.</p>\n<p>The contention of the Company is that the statute denies to the Express Company due process, in that: (a) it is so vague, uncertain and indefinite as to be void; (b) it provides no measure or standard by which to distinguish the railroads in connection with an express business, \"and no provision of law is elsewhere found by which it can be ascertained as to what are first class railroad tracks and second and third class railroad tracks in connection with an express business;\" (c) although the Supreme Court of Mississippi has held that first, second and third class railroads referred to in § 21 are those required by § 45 to be classified by the Railroad Commission, and although the effect of said holding may be to engraft upon § 21, § 45, even assuming that the connection between the section and their purposes be thus conclusively established by the decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi, \"there still is found neither measure nor standard for classifying railroad trackage for the purpose of taxing the express business operated over such trackage, inasmuch as the classification of railroads under § 45, c. 104, etc., is for the sole purpose <i>`of levying a privilege tax on railroads;'\"</i> (d) if the classification of railroads despite its purpose can be so extended, there is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> no provision for notice and hearing to express companies when the classification of railroads is made.</p>\n<p>There is the further contention that plaintiff in error is denied the equal protection of the laws in that: (a) damages in an amount equal to the privilege tax are allowed against it because it failed to pay the privilege tax before entering business on May 1, 1921, while other express companies as well as all other persons and corporations subject to privilege taxes already in business are allowed thirty days after the privilege tax accrues annually within which to pay the same, and \"that the discrimination under the law in this respect is arbitrary and unwarranted by any sound reason or principle of distinction;\" (b) railroads are accorded the right to be heard upon the correctness of the classification made by the commission which governs the classification under the law for the purpose of levying privilege taxes upon them. while express companies are not accorded a hearing when the classification is made upon them, and are not allowed to present facts either as to the value of particular trackage relative to an express business, or that which under the law governs the classification for the purpose of levying privilege taxes upon railroads.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of the State held adversely to all of these contentions and we think in correct estimate of them.</p>\n<p>If it can be conceded to the Express Company that the statute had vagueness, it was competent for the court to resolve it to clearness, which it did by an explanation of the laws and the relation of their provisions, and deduced therefrom their constitutionality and freedom from the objections urged against them. We are not disposed to an enumeration of the objections. They are somewhat involved. A prominent one is, and it is variously expressed, that the Express Company was not heard in the classification of railroads, it being insisted that between the latter fact and the express business there is intimate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> relation and therefore the same right of hearing to the Express Company as to railroads. But the fact of the classification of railroads was one that preceded the Express Company, of which it was aware, and was an element in the estimate of the privilege that was to be granted, for only over the railroads the privilege could be exercised. There was no element of judicial inquiry. The tax was the condition of a privilege to carry on a business  might, indeed, be denominated a license, but call it privilege or license, it was a condition the State could impose, and having the option to impose it, could fix its amount directly or by reference to a standard. <i>Hagar</i> v. <i>Reclamation District,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91153\"><a href=\"/opinion/91153/hagar-v-reclamation-dist-no-108/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>; <i>Ohio Tax Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98114\"><a href=\"/opinion/98114/ohio-tax-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The objection that the Express Company was not given a hearing upon the classification of railroads is made a basis for the contention that the Express Company is denied the equal protection of the laws. In specification of this it is said that railroads are entitled to be heard upon their classification, and, therefore, upon the condition upon which the amount of the privilege tax upon them depends, while a hearing is denied to express companies when necessarily the classification is as intimate to and a condition of the tax upon them as upon the railroads. The Supreme Court of the State found reasons for the difference, and there is certainly a difference between railroads and express companies of themselves and necessarily in their relations to their respective businesses, and, against the action of the State and the judgment of its courts, the difference cannot be regarded as not of legal consideration in the imposition of an excise upon the express companies.</p>\n<p>It is further urged that there is a discrimination offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in the laws of Mississippi permitting damages against the Express Company in an amount equal to the privilege tax because it failed to pay the tax before entering, May 1, 1921, while <span class=\"star-pagination\">*541</span> other companies, persons and corporations already in business are allowed thirty days after the taxes accrue annually within which to pay them. The Supreme Court of the State decided against the contention, and we think that there is difference enough in the situations to justify the difference in the provision and exempt it from the charge of unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p>The court thereupon reversed the judgment of the court below and rendered judgment in favor of Robertson for both the tax and damages sued for and, under the practice of the court, entered judgment to that effect with interest and costs.</p>\n<p><i>Judgment affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
