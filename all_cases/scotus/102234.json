The ordinance, which imposes a tax of 3 per cent. of the gross income from appellant's business of furnishing gas to consumers in the city of Seattle and the federal questions raised are the same as those in Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Appellant's bill of complaint, demurrer to which was sustained by the state court, alleges that the appellant is engaged in the distribution of gas, used for lighting in the city of Seattle, in competition with the city, the appellee, which conducts an electric light business, and that its constitutional rights are infringed by the imposition of the tax.
